My name is Michael and this blog will be detailing my experiences through the daily grind of lifting the iron.  I began lifting seriously during my sophomore year of college in hopes of becoming stronger and healthier.  My drive for lifting and my mission of being more health conscious is rooted in my fears of developing the same debilitating medical conditions that my father encountered in his middle age.  With this blog, it is my hope that it will provide motivation to others about becoming stronger and healthier and to provide me with the fuel to become stronger and be consistent in my training and everyday life.
