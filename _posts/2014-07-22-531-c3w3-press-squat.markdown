It's somewhat frightening how well the body can adapt to stressful stimuli and become better adapted the next time it experiences a very similar stress.  The last 3 months of the Boring But Big challenge has allowed me to observe this first hand.  Last week, I struggled with completing the BBB 70% bench press, while today, I had a relatively breezy time going through the sets.  I also had an epiphany while doing the bench.  For some time now, my form has been causing my right triceps/chest to work much harder than my left triceps and chest.  One thing that I tried differently, on a whim, was to squeeze the bar.  As I squeezed the bar, I also flashbacked to reading about gripping the bar as if you were trying to snap it in half.  This immediately engaged my left lats and left chest much more and as a result I was able to quickly feel a better balance of the bar across my chest.
