**Weight:  182.0**

**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
3 x 5 x 240

Body was pretty tight.  Very weird, I felt perfectly fine on rest day, but pretty tired the second day after the workout.  I was stuck in the hole for a really long time on the last rep of the last set, but pushed through.  I spent a good amount of time resting between sets.  I was struggling already from the first set.  Going to look into stretching and getting my body to recover better on rest days.

**Press:**

5 x Bar
3 x 65
2 x 75
3 x 5 x 87.5

Noticed that my right lats were working much harder than my left.  I need to look into really fixing my form.

**Deadlifts:**

5 x 175
3 x 205
2 x 235
5 x 275

Much harder than my previous deadlift workouts.  I think fatigue from the squat carried over to the deadlift.  I felt my legs being used more on the lift today.

**Accessories:**

****3/3/2 x BW Pull-ups - I was a bit more conservative on these pull-ups.  I could have probably done 4 reps on the first set.

3 x 10 x 15 lb reverse crunch - Pretty easy

4/7/4/8/4/7
