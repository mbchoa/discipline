**Cycle #4**

**Press:**  5x70, 5x85, 5x95

First set scared me a bit.  I heard my right shoulder crackling and I had that feeling I get when my shoulder is about to pop out of it's socket.  Didn't do shoulder dislocations so they may have been tighter than I wanted.  Also didn't do DeFranco's upper body stretches.  I'm a bit disappointed I couldn't get more reps out on the 3rd set.

**BBB Press:  **5x10x50

I was contemplating for a while about what I wanted to do assistance-wise in this new cycle.  "The Triumvirate" and Dave Tate's "Periodization Bible" both looked very enticing.  But, the question that kept popping into my head was, "Why change it if it ain't broke?"  I've seen some good numbers come out of the last three months and I decided I'm going for another 3 months using Boring But Big.  I've had plenty of difficulties with my shoulder and chest strength and I think performing more of the same problematic exercises will help me develop my technique and hopefully improve on those weaknesses.

**Chin-ups:  **6/3/3/3/3 x BW

First set felt very strong.  Later sets...not so much.  I'm aiming for 10 for the first set by the end of this cycle.

**Conditioning:**

10% incline
2x1min. sprints @ 5spd
13min. walk @ 2spd

If time permits, I'm going to go for 2 miles each day.  I'll sprint more on my deadlift, squat days.
