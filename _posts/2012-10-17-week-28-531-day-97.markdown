**Cycle #7
Week 3 Day 2**

Gym time has been really out of sync this past 2 weeks.  I've planned on moving to a new gym and so I'm probably going to avoid going gung-ho on the lifts until I get settled in.  The first I visited was fairly low key.  Looks to be office space rented out and turned into a gym. Didn't look like much until I saw the other half which was a totally different space than the other half.  High ceilings, 30 yds of what I would guess was astroturf.  Saw 2 squat stands- I'd never squatted using these before, was pretty cool.  The gym, however, did not have dipping stations which is a bit irksome, but, right now, any gym I can find that is cheaper than my current $99 a month membership is good news.  Going to check out some other ones in the area.

**Squat:  **5xBar, 5x115, 3x135, 3x155 + 5x185, 3x205, 3x225

**Conditioning:  **Treadmill + 1mile + 3.0 spd
