Miraculously finished all 5 sets of the squat- how exactly?  I don't know.  Stalled pretty hard on the bench.  I'm definitely using my right arm more than my left arm.  It also feels like I may have a small muscle imbalance (right arm is a bit bigger than my left arm).  I managed to get my left arm to work more when I shifted the barbell a bit to the left.  I didn't get a chance to do anymore after bench, I had to leave for a friend's birthday outting.  I'll be row'ing the same weight come next A session.
