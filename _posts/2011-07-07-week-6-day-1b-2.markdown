Had a really good workout.  Started a bit late today.  The free weights area was pretty much empty, so I got my subtle grunt on.  "Looping" underneath the bar helped with getting a tight upper back and keeping it.  I forgot to bring my camera, but I think I'm twisting my body when I go down.  Seems like I twist my waist right and some of the weight is brought on to my left leg.

Bench press was alright.  Lift seems to be heavily a mental mind game with myself.  Extended rest for the 4th and 5th set.

Rows were still fairly easy.
