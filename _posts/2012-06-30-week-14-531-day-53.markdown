**Cycle #4**

I got a bit fancy on the assistance.  I still did my BBB, but I've always wanted to include a bit more pressing to improve upon my bench.

**Bench:  **5x70, 5x85, 3x100 + 3x120, 3x135, **7x155 Rep PR**

I actually got to 8 reps, but I pretty much stalled halfway up and spotter had to assist me up to re-rack.  Pretty happy I got to 7 reps on my own.  One thing I didn't like was that when I was really struggling to get the bar up, I noticed that I was sort of trying to sort of press with my shoulders by shrugging and almost rolling my right side upward towards the bar.  I've addressed a number of times before that I think I've developed a minor "imbalance", if you will, of my pressing due to my right arm / lats / upper back working a bit harder.  It's fairly noticeable too- my right arm is actually burning while my left side feels unhindered.

**BBB **Bench**:  **5x10x85

Pretty easy.  I actually used some varying grips here- 2 sets of narrow, 1 regular, 2 wide.

**Pull:**

2 x Wide Grip
4 x  Chin-up
2 x 10x35lb DB Row

**Push:**

2 x 10x25lb DB Incline Press
10 x 55lb BB Incline Press
