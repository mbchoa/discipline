**Cycle #6
****Week 1 Day 1**

**5/3/1 Press:  **5x45, 3x55, 1x70 + 5x80, 5x90, 5x105**
**

Used a false grip and managed to crank out at least 5 reps on the top set.  I didn't think of it at the time, but I completely forgot to go all out on the top set.  Also, the bar was rolling back into the top of my hand a bit too much causing a lot of strain on my wrists, mainly my right.  The descent of the bar needs to a bit more controlled because I can see myself seriously injuring my wrists if I just drop the weight down and the bar rolls back.  Even if I only managed to get 5 reps, it's a vast improvement from the previous cycle's 105 attempt at only 2 reps achieved so I'm definitely happy.

**BB Assistance:**

DB Military Press:  12x15lb + 3x12x20lb
Barbell Curl:  3x12x30lb
Side Laterals:  2x12x10lb
Rear Laterals:  2x12x10lb
Preacher Curl:  10x35 + 10x40 + 2x10x45

I went through these pretty quickly so my arms became jelly pretty quickly.  Didn't realize I was supposed to do the DB military presses seated or at least that's how the majority of people do it.  I lowered the weight on the side and rear laterals to 10lbs- 15lbs was way too heavy for me.  The BB curl weight remained static and I ramped the preacher curl weight until the 3rd set.

**Conditioning:**

0.5 mile walk
