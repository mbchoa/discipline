**Deadlift**:  2x5x70 + 1x3x105 + 1x2x150 + 1x5x180

Squat form wasn't superb today.  I think my hips definitely traveled forward when I lifted my head up and looked straight ahead.  I think I was falling back into the lordotic
back arch squat with my head going up too much instead of focusing on looking straight down.  I also wasn't paying attention to the cue of lifting ass first.  

Bench was fairly light.  The added weight is finally locking in the form, but, again, I'm feeling most of the tightness on the right lats and delts.  Will definitely read
through the bench chapter in Rippetoe's book thoroughly.

Deadlifts were pretty easy.  I didn't spread the stance too wide out this time.  Kept bar close.
