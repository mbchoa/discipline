Decided to test where I'm at currently with my lifts so I tested 1RMs (single rep max)

**Squat:  **225lbs

**Press:  **95lbs

**Deadlift:  **245lbs

**Bench:  **175lbs

I'll be using these numbers to program into a fresh cycle of 5/3/1 again.

I'll admit I've been suffering from exercise ADD, so I'm going to have a run at 5/3/1 again for at least 3 cycles.
