Pretty packed gym today.  3 squat racks were all being used.  Kindly asked a couple who were squatting if I could work in using an empty bar.  Got some confused and/or upset gestures.  Seems like the question did not compute properly.  Decided to clean the bar off the ground, press overhead and drop the bar behind the neck instead.  My right shoulder held up, but I don't believe any behind the neck pressing movements are the best for them.  Nonetheless, I managed to get my core lifts in.  The two bench stations were also being used and so I was not able to use them.  Instead, I performed incline dumbbell presses.
