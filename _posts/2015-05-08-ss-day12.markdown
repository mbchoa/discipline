**Squats**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x75 + 1x3x115 + 1x2x155 + 3x5x195

**Press**:  3x5x45 + 1x3x55 + 1x2x65 + 5x3x80

**Pullups**:  2/2/1.5

Squats were pretty brutal.  Grinded out last rep of 2nd set and last 2 reps of 3rd set.  Don't think my form is holding up.  I feel like I may
be doing a bit of a good morning with my ass going up faster than my shoulders.  Definitely felt it in the lower back.  I didn't miss a rep this
time because I rested plenty between the sets.  Around 4 minutes for the first rest period and maybe 3.5 minutes to 4 on the second rest period
Thinking of belting up on the last set moving forward.  Thinking whether or not to go up to 200 or 197.5.  Will need to pick up fractional plates 
if I go up by 2.5.

Press was really damn strong today.  Brought my elbows forward and made sure to keep my wrist in line with the forearm to prevent the bar from
rolling back.  It was really easy to push the bar up.

Just chowed down a meaty 1/2 lb double cheese burger from Wendy's.  I completely did not expect to be getting the 1/2 lb burger.  Ended up getting
3.  Still have the other two waiting.  Sloshed down the hefty burger with some whole milk.  About 2-3 cups.
