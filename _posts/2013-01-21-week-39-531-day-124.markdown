**Cycle #4
****Week 1 Day 1**

** 5/3/1 Press: ** 3x65, 3x75, 3x85
**DB Military Press:  **4x12x25lb
**Side Laterals:  **4x12x10lb
**Standing Barbell Curls:  **4x12x30lb
**Preacher Curls:  **4x12x30lb

Yep, skipped deload week for cycle 3.  Going to do another cycle of the bodybuilder template.  I think I'm making good progress on the lifts, bench, especially.  Although, I do think I'm slowing down on deadlifts because of the decrease in volume.
