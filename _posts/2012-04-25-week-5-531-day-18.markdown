**Cycle #2**

**Agile 8 + DeFranco's  **

**Deadlift:**  5x95, 3x125, 2x165 + 5x185, 5x210, 5x240

These felt pretty solid.  Didn't use alternating grip yet.  Used hook grip on the 2nd and 3rd sets.

**Boring But Big 60%**

**Squat**: 5x10x165

Increased weight on the squats killed me today.  Haven't felt so exhausted in such a long time.  Felt easier on the later reps.  Rested a lot between sets.
