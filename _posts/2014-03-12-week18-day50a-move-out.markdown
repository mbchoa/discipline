**Weight:  **188.2 lbs

Finally moving into the new apartment.  Living the independent life.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x175 + 2x205 + 1x225 + 5x260

Managed to crank out 5 reps going deep into the squat.  Rested between 4th and 5th reps on the top set for about 7 seconds, taking big gulps of air in.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x75 + 3x95 + 2x115 + 1x135 + 5x150 + 5/5/5/5/**4** x 135 **(1)
**

Sort of all over the place with bench.  I forgot that I had to deload for today so I performed a single set of 150.  Still managed to stall on the last set, hah!  Going for 135 again next time around and will be focusing on form.

**Rows:  **5x135 + 3x135 + 2x135 + 3x3x160

Decided to drop down reps from 5 down to 3.  My form and technique is pretty much garbage after the first few reps so I'd like to capitalize on these first few reps rather than delude myself into thinking I can do 5 when I can actually only do 3 reps with good form.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  10/6/4/6/4 (30)
Pull ups:  3/2/1/1/1/1 (10)

Rests between the sets are important, I've found.  Pull-ups were lagging behind the dips, I had finished my 30 reps of dips and still had to do 3 reps on the pull ups.  These two exercises are performed in alternating fashion.

**Conditioning:
**Intervals:  5 min. + rest @ 3.0spd + sprints @ 6.0-6.5 spd

Calves are no longer suffering severe DOMs after running.  My running strides feel much more comfortable and confident.
