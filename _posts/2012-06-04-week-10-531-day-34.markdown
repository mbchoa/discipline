**Cycle #3**

**Squat:**  5x115, 5x135, 3x155, 2x175 + 3x205, 3x230, **4x260**

These were very heavy.  I had my belt on for them.  Fourth rep, I leaned over quite a bit and felt like I did a good morning.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Deadlift:  **8/6/5/4/4 x 205

Used a belt on all the sets.  Probably shouldn't of done that, but I was feeling especially exhausted after the squat core lift.

**Hanging Knee Raise: **8/6/5

Felt pretty weak on these- skipping them obviously the cause.

**Treadmill:  **

10% incline
3 min. 2.5 spd warm-up
2 x 1 min. 5.0 spd / 1 min. 3.0 spd
