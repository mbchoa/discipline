**Weight: **186.0 lbs

Nice and succinct work out.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x175 + 2x200 + 1x225 + **4x250 (1)**

I'm usually aiming for 5 reps on these.  Couldn't get the last rep out.  First stall at 250.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x6x15
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x6x15

A bit more difficult than last time.

**Deadlift: **5x135 + 3x165 + 2x185 + 1x205 + 1x225 + 5x255

Strained low back a bit after the first two sets.  The rest of the sets were good.  Top set felt strong, didn't feel like I was rounding the back.  Stance was fairly narrow.  Kept the bar about halfway point on foot.  Having my feet too far forward, I think, has attributed to me rounding my back in the past.  Alternating grip on the top set.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  10
Pushups:  2x20
Wide-Grip Pull-ups:  2/2/2

I enjoy these shorter post core lift accessories.

**Conditioning:
**Treadmill: 5 minutes - alternating 30 sec. @ 2.8-3.2 spd / 30 sec. @ 5.6-5.9 spd

Didn't know where the stationary bikes were so I hopped on the treadmill again.  Strides felt better.  Increased active intervals speed from 5.5 to between 5.6 and 5.9 speeds.  Still felt pretty comfortable with this, but then again I only ran for about 5 minutes.  Regardless, I enjoy doing intervals much more than steady state running and I think probably healthier for my knees in the long run- less time under impact is always good for me.
