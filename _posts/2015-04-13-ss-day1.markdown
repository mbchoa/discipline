**Weight**:  181.0

**Squats**:  2x5x45 + 3x5x95

**Bench**:  2x5x45 + 3x5x75

**Deadlift**:  2x5x135 + 1x5x165

Workout ADD in full effect.  Finally bit the bullet and bought the Starting Strength (3rd Edition) book written by Mr. Mark Rippetoe.  My impatience has certainly
gotten the best of me.  I want to get strong...fast.  The squats and bench lifts will go up by 10lbs per workout.  The deadlift and press will go up by 15lbs and
5lbs, respectively.
