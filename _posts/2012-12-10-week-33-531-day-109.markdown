**Cycle #6
****Week 2 Day 1**

**5/3/1 Press:  **3x60, 3x70, 3x75
**BBB Press:  **5x10x45

Starting this week with going to the gym in the AM.  Sleep time from the night before was around 10:30pm latest so I could get up with enough sleep at 5AM this morning.  Surprisingly, I was able to wake up without much effort.  The one thing though that kept me from going back to sleep (I only snoozed twice, which is a first in a long time) was this piercing pain in my right shoulder.  It just felt like a knife was lodged in my shoulder when I lay down.  The pain progressively worsened from no pain when I first lay down.

It's definitely humbling to see other people already up and working out in the early hours.
