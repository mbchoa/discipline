**Squats:**

5 x Bar
5 x 165
3 x 185
2 x 205
5 x 225

**Bench:**

****2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 75
3 x 95
2 x 115
5 x 135

**Power Cleans:**

****10 x 95
8 x 115

**Accessories:**

****11/6/4 x BW + 10 lbs - Going to ramp up weight again.  I will keep increasing the weight until I can't do greater than or equal to 10 reps on the first set.

3 x 12 x 10 lbs Reverse Crunches - Pretty easy, I think I need to progress on this exercise, maybe start doing dragon flags?  I'll have to look into how to do them.
