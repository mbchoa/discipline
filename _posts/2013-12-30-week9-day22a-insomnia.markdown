**Weight:  **179.8
**Duration:  **11:08pm - 12:21pm 1hr 13min.

Couldn't get to sleep for the life of me last night.  Brain just decided to go full throttle.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x95 + 3x115 + 1x135 + 5x5x150

Shoulder felt pretty amazing today.  I managed to lower the bar a bit more and balance it across my back with little to no bothersome pain in my right shoulder!  BUT, I was tweaking my lower back a bit on the last 2 sets.  Felt some lower back strain.  Shoulders may have been coming up much faster than hips so I was transferring load to the low back via pseudo-Good Morning.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 2x5x65 + 5x75 + 5x5x95

Felt very strong on these.  Didn't go thumbless.  Made sure to shrug and keep a tight shoulder.  Used power lifter arch and tucked the elbows on the way down and flared them out on the way up.  Right shoulder felt like it worked a bit harder on a few reps.

**Rows:  **5x65** + **5x95 + 5x5x110

These felt pretty heavy today.  Squeezing the bar helps a lot with contracting the muscles pre-pull.  Still pretty heavy though.

**Accessories:
**Seated DB Curls:  8x30**
**Preacher BB Curls:  10x40
Standing BB Curls:  10x40
Incline DB Press:  10x30 + 8x35
DB Bench Press:  20x30

Easy peezy lemon squeezy for sheezy.
