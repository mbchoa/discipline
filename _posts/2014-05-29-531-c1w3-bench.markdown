**Bench:  **5x55 + 5x70 + 5x80 + 5x105 + 3x115 + 7x130 (156.02 1RM)
**BBB Press:  **3x10x40 + 2x9x40
**DB Rows:  **5x10x35
**BB Curls:  **3x10x40
**Dips:  **3x5
**Face Pulls: ** 3x10x30

Did some dips in place of the tricep pushdowns.  Tricep pushdowns are great for the isolation of the triceps, but I decided to drop it in place of dips to get the best bang for the buck.  Haven't done dips in a while so there was definitely some difficulty getting them going.  I was tweaking my left shoulder at the top of the press so I backed off a bit, thus the 9 rep sets.
