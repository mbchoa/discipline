**Cycle #2**

**Agile 8 + DeFranco's Upperbody Stretches  **Slowed down the "climbing" for the mountain climbers to get a good stretch.

**Press:**  3x5xBar + 3x70, 3x80, 3x90

These "felt" much better than my previous presses.  I'm feeling very confident with the presses now with the way I'm locking out at the top.

**Boring But Big 60%**

**Bench Press**: 3x10xBar + 5x10x95

Felt pretty confident on these.  Focused on shrugging and pushing through the bench.

**Lat Pulldown**:  5x10x55

Felt very easy.  I might try chin-ups next time.

**Curls**:  3x10x30 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x30 + **Face pull: **3x10x25

Pretty easy superset of these exercises.  Made sure to pull slowly on the pull as well as slowly release to get the workout on the negative portion of the pull.
