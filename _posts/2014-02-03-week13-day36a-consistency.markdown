**Weight:  **186.4 lbs
**Duration:  **12:35pm - 1:50pm ~ 1hr. 15min.

Simplicity and minimalism.  Some people scoff at the notion of having to experience, generally, the same thing over and over again.  I'll agree to a point- I get bored pretty easily too.   Sometimes, things can get seemingly monotonous and we decide to seek change.  However, in the realm of strength training, personal experience has shown me that consistency from beginning to end is king.  Sustaining a periodized program to leverage linear progression is the only way I know how to get stronger and it has yet to fail me.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar +5x115 + 3x145 + 2x165 + 1x185 + 3x5x210

Felt strong on these, especially on the first 2-3 sets.  I made sure not to round the back even when I was grinding out the last 2 reps.  I rested about 3 minutes before the 4th and 5th sets.

**Bench:  **3x10xBar +10x75 + 10x95 + 1x115 + 5/5/4/5/4 x 130

Stalled on the bench, yeouch.  I was trying to rest at most 30 seconds between sets.  Fatigue got the best of me.

**Rows:  **5x85 + 3x105 + 1x125 + 5x5x145

At this point, I think I need to record myself and judge whether or not I'm totally butchering form.  I do know that I'm jerking quite a bit with my upper body which certainly takes away training for strength.
