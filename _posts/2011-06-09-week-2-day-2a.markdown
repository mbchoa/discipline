Bright idea to wear sweat pants in searing 91 degree weather.  Sweaty legs didn't help with the squats either as my legs stuck to the sweat pants thereby adding resistance during the negative of the squat.  Felt like I was leaning forwards more today when doing squat; sweatpants could be the possible culprit.  Jumped 5 lbs on the Bench and 5 lbs down on the Row.  Mixed up the weights for the 2 lifts.  Really need to bring notepad with me to keep track of weights.  Rows were relatively easy.  Walkouts got me shaking; I wanted to do 230 walkouts, but was too afraid I wouldn't be able to re-rack the bar as I already had a hard time with the 185lbs.  All in all, another good workout.
