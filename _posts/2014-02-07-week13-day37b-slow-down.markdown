**Weight: **186.0 lbs 
**Duration**:  11:35am - 1:25pm ~ 1:50 min.

Well, it's about that time.  Initial strength gains are slowing down quite a bit.  Taking quite a bit more rest time between sets on the core lifts.  I'm assessing whether or not I want to continue with SL or move on.  Madcow has been on my mind which would move me from workout-to-workout progressions to weekly progressions.  With weekly progressions, I can aim to break PRs on the 4th week of the cycle.  I can back off on my current weights and perhaps drop the current volume down by 15-20%.  This would give me some perhaps needed rest period before I start hitting 80%+ RM weights again.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x135 + 3x155 + 2x175 + 1x195 + 3x5x215

Last rep was a grinder.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x10x12
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x10x12

Squat definitely affected my ability to get through these.  They were a bit more difficult than the previous sessions' workout.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 3x155 + 2x185 + 1x215 + 1x245 + 5x275

Definitely felt bad form on these.  I was lifting with my back once I got the bar up to my knee.  I felt disgusted doing the 5 reps because I completely knew my form was not good.  This is all coming off very negative, but knowing you actually have a problem is a great first step to figuring how to solve the problem.

**Accessories:
**Preacher BB Curls:  15x50
Incline DB Press:  10x45
Standing EZ Bar Curls:  12x40
Dips:  **14**/**4**/4
Seated DB Curls:  10x30
Pushups:  **15**/8/6

Dips were improved, but most likely due to it being B day a.k.a. no bench press.  Pushups were also improved for the first set, narrow arm positions.
