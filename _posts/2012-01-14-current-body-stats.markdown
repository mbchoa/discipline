Surprisingly, after using my new (and free!) fat calipers, I discovered that I'm at 12.6% body fat.  Quite a big difference from my previously calculated 21% body fat.  This makes more sense considering I can somewhat see my top and middle 2 ablets.  I'm going to try and cut down to around 8-9% bodyfat.  I think some extra cardio after workouts is due, so I'll include some light running after each workout.
