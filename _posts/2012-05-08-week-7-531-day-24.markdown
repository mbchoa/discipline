**Cycle #2**

**Agile 8 + DeFranco's**

Mountain climbers were much better today.

**Press:**  5xBar + 5x75, 3x85, 1x95

Bar was rolling back into my wrists on the last set.  Need to make sure I clench the bar hard to avoid this.

**Boring But Big 60%**

**Bench Press**: 3x10xBar + 5x10x85

Felt inconsistent.  Right arm and lats were burning after 3rd set.

**Chinups**:  4/3/2/2/1

Wanted to test my chinning strength out.  Definitely disappointed that I haven't really gotten stronger in this department.

**Curls**:  3x10x30 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x30 + **Face pull: **3x10x25

Got a bit more burn than the usual on these.  Reps were slower on each exercise.
