**Cycle #3**

**Squat:**  5x185, 5x215, 5x245

I had some difficulty with these.  My form seems to be pretty good- bar is no longer moving up onto my traps.  Wrists are buckling sideways a bit though.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Deadlift:  **5/5/4/4/2x205

Used some long formal socks to avoid scraping the knees.  These were heavy.  Couldn't get to 10 reps on a single set.
