**Cycle #5
****Week 4 Day 1**

It's deload week so workouts are quick and light.  Always enjoy deload week as I get to hone lift form and technique and do some reflection on the last month- kind of like grading myself.  I was also, however, contemplating about skipping the deload.  Sometimes, the monthly progression gets to me, "This is too damn slow, I want to be faster, stronger, bigger...now."  And it can be difficult sometimes to dial myself back and to really appreciate that the "slow", hard work I'm putting in now will be realized months and years from now and not tomorrow.  This is a daily constant reminder, not just in lifting, but in other aspects of everyday life.

**5/3/1 Press:  **5x45, 5x60, 5x70**
**

Used a false grip.  Pretty easy- I played around with my grip width, pinky vs ring finger on the finger guide.

**BB Assistance:**

DB Military Press:  12x20lb + 12x15lb + 2x12x10lb
Barbell Curl:  12x40lb + 3x12x30lb
Side Laterals:  2x10x10lb
Rear Laterals:  2x10x10lb
Preacher Curl:  10x45lb + 3x10x25lb

**Conditioning:**

3 min. 3.0 spd 10% incline
3 min. 2.5 spd 5% incline

Calves were still a bit sore from the past weekend's hiking so I didn't get to doing any sprints- probably should have to get the blood flowing.
