**Cycle #5
Week 3 Day 4 + Week 4 Day 1**

Falling a bit behind on the log.  Doing some catch-up.

**Friday, 8/10 (Squat Day):  **3x200, 3x230, **2x260 Rep Failure **+ 10/8/6/5 x 145

Up until that Friday, I had missed my previous 2 squat sessions.  It definitely took it's toll as I had an extremely difficult time getting the 260 up with a belt on.  The Boring But Big set wasn't any prettier.  Not sure if I should dial the weight back down or not.  1 step back, 2 steps forward?  We'll see how the weight feels this coming Friday.

**Monday, 8/13 (Press Day):  **5x85, 3x100, **3x110 Rep PR **+ BBB Bench:  5x10x100 + Chin-ups:  6/4/4 + BBRows:  2x10x70lbs

I wasn't too excited about doing presses yesterday.  I re-injured my right shoulder the past weekend and it wasn't feeling wonderful.  I sucked it up and did the presses anyway.  Used a false grip and really engaged my lats.  I had read earlier in the day that using the lats as a shelf really helps with the lift and indeed it did.  The press definitely feels much better with a false grip compared to a regular grip- significantly less wrist strain which in turn provides a much more stable pressing foundation at the bottom of the lift.
