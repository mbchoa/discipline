**Weight:  **183 lbs

Started on Madcow5x5 today after a week long rest.  I wanted to get to about the 6 month mark before switching over, but I decided against it.  While the workout-to-workout progressive loading is no longer the case with Madcow (week-to-week), the sessions do have a higher amount of volume.  No accessories done at the moment.  Most likely will sprinkle in a small amount for ab, posterior chain work and some weighted dips for weak chest and pull ups to offset it.

**Squats:  **5x115 + 5x145 + 5x175 + 5x200 + 5x230

**Bench:  **5x65 + 5x80 + 5x95 + 5x110 + 5x125

**Rows:  **5x75 + 5x90 + 5x110 + 5x125 + 5x145
