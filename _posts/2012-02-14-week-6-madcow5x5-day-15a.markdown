**Squats:**

5 x 130
5 x 160
5 x 190
5 x 225
5 x 255 (belt)

Surprised I wasn't as tired as I expected after the 4th set.  Back definitely rounded on the top set.  Learning forward a bit too much and going a bit too low.

**Bench:**

5 x 70
5 x 85
5 x 100 (really good set)
5 x 120
5 x 135

These were pretty easy.  Third set was the perfect set.  From what I remember, I think instead of lowering the bar to my chest, I simply lowered it straight down and straight up.  My grip wasn't wobbly, the bar was comfortable resting at the base of my palm.  This made the 5 reps ridiculously easy.  I couldn't replicate the grip on the 4th and 5th set unfortunately.

**Rows:**

5 x 70
5 x 85
5 x 100
5 x 120
5 x 135

Not bad.  I have to post my video to see if I'm doing these properly.

**Accessories:**

Weighted Situps - 25xBW, 17x10, 16x10, 12x15:  Not bad.  Decided to do until "failure" on each set.  Slow and steady preferred on these to get the abs burning.
