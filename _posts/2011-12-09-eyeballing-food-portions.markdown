Found a nifty article on ezine while looking for example meals I could make. Â My routine meals are getting insanely boring so I was looking for some fresh ideas and came across this helpful tidbit.

Portion/Size:
1 oz. meat = Matchbox,
3 oz. meat = Deck of cards,
8 oz. meat = Thin paperback book,
3 oz. fish = Checkbook,
1 oz. cheese = Four dice,
1 med. potato = Computer mouse,
2 tbsp. peanut butter = Ping pong ball,
1 cup pasta = Tennis ball,
1 bagel = Hockey puck
