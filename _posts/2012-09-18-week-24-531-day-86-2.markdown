**Cycle #6
Week 3 Day 4**

**Warm-up:  **foam roll, leg swings, box jumps

Box jumps are pretty easy now.  Still am a bit hesitant that I'll totally wipe out on the first jump.  Worked up a decent sweat doing this warm-up.

**Deadlift:  **5x120, 5x150, 3x180 + 5x225, 3x250, **10x280 Rep PR**

Got a rep PR, but not sure I did it without some not so great form.  The first rep, right off the bat, felt like a straight legged deadlift.  Not sure if I was rounding much.  Used alternating grip on the last set and the 3 rep set; left hand pronated, right hand supinated.  The bar I was using didn't have a very good grip on the knurling section.

**BB Assistance:**

6/4/3/2 - Chin-ups: Felt fresh when doing these.  Haven't done them in a while.
10x30 + 10x35 + 10x35 + 10x40 - DB Rows:  Felt easier than when I did them last.
10x45 + 10x55 + 10x65 + 10x75 - Good Mornings:  Not bad.  Had a significantly wider grip. Made sure the bar didn't roll into my neck.  Had pretty much a slightly low bar placement to keep locked against my anterior delts.
5/5/5 x Ab Wheel:  Back buckled very easily when getting fatigued and was giving me some lower back pain so I eased back off them.  Think I may need to increase core strength before doing these.

**Conditioning:**

10min. x Treadmill:  Haven't ran in a while.  Felt very sluggish.  My cardio stamina diminishes very quickly if I don't keep at it.
