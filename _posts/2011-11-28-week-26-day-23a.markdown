**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 175
3 x 195
2 x 215
5 x 240

Getting pretty heavy.  Recovery is definitely slowing down again.

**Bench:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 85
3 x 105
2 x 125
5 x 140

Extremely easy.

**Clean Progression:**

5 x 3 x 85 Clean shrug
5 x 3 x  85 Front squat

**Accessories:**

10.5/5/4 x BW + 12.5 Dips - Pretty difficult, I'll see what happens when I jump up to 15 lbs.

3 x 12 x 7.5 lbs Reverse crunches
