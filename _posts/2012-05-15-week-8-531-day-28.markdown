**Cycle #2**

**Agile 8 **Didn't do DeFranco's.  I was training my younger brother on proper lower body stretches and bottom position squat static stretches.  He's not too flexible and it's hampering his ability to get into an optimal squatting position in the hole.

**Press:**  5x40, 5x50, 5x60

Very easy.

**Boring But Big 60%**

**Bench Press**: 3x10xBar + 5x10x85

Right arm was working a bit harder than the left.

**Chinups**:  5/4/3/2/2

Did a bit better on these compared to last week's first time.  Looking up helps engage more muscles to pull myself up.

**Curls**:  3x10x30 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x30 + **Face pull: **3x10x25

These were a bit rushed and so I didn't perform as well on the later sets.
