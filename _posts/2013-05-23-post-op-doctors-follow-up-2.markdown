Had my follow up doctor's appointment after the 4 weeks in the sling.  Everything looked good apparently.  How they determine how well I've recovered, I have no clue.  I can't raise my arm straight up yet.  I've been prescribed physical therapy for 4 weeks, 2 weeks less than what I had anticipated, so good definitely good news!  I'll be back in effect hopefully by  June 24th assuming I start my PT next Monday, May 27, but I think I'm going to try and start earlier, perhaps tomorrow.  The last 4 weeks in the sling flew by pretty quickly.  I anticipate the next 4 weeks of PT will be a bit rockier.
