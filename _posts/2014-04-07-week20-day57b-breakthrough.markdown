**Weight: **181.3

Weekend was amazing- really got me hitting the ground running for the week, maybe even for the rest of the month!

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x195 + 2x235 + 5x270

I abbreviated the warm-ups and it seems like it may have given me some extra gas in the tank to finish out the top set of 270.  This also meant that warm-up weights had bigger jumps from warm-up set to warm-up set.  No heavy grunting, tried to keep all the air in as much as possible to maintain rigidity in my core.  I think this also helped.

**Press:  **5xBar + 5x5x70

Wobbly, not really from the lack of shoulder pressing strength, but rather keeping the entire trunk and core solid to keep balance.  The press was still pretty difficult, however.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 3x175 + 2x205 + 1x235 + 5x275

Have to really make sure I'm not rolling the bar down my knees, especially the left knee cap.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  10/6
