**Weight: **188.2 lbs

Busy during lunch so I couldn't head out to the gym, so I decided leave work a bit earlier and go after.  Gym was insanely packed.  I've never seen so many people in a gym at one time.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x135 + 3x150 + 2x75 + 1x195 + 1x205 + 1x225 + **3x255 (1)**

Couldn't reach 5 reps.  The reps were very controlled going down.  Maybe TOO controlled, as in I was going a bit too slow.  Ideally, movements should try to be done explosively, but I'm too afraid of increasing stress on the knees if I drop too quickly.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x6x15
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x6x15

Shortened rest periods between sets made these harder.

**Deadlift: **5x135 + 3x165 + 2x185 + 1x205 + 1x225 + 5x260

I'm still progressing pretty well on these.  The jump from the 225 to 260 may be a bit much, so I should probably re-do the poundage on the ramping warm-up sets.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  10/8/6
Wide-Grip Pull-ups:  2/1/1

Pull-ups were harder today.  My right shoulder was also not too happy about them.  Dips felt good.  The first set is usually rocky as I try to stabilize my core so I don't swing during the exercise.
