It's been about 3 months since I started lifting again.  There were definitely some rocky points, especially very recently.

These are the stats from Week 1 -> Week 12:

**Weight**:  150lbs -> 185lbs (+35)

**Squat:  **5x45lbs -> 5x200lbs (+155)
**Bench****:  **5x45lbs -> 5x125lbs (+80)
**Deadlift:  **5x95lbs -> 5x255lbs (+160)
**Rows:  **5x65lbs -> 5x140lbs (+75)
