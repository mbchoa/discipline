Decent workout.  Made the mistake of downing a yogurt on top of a cup of coffee immediately before heading out to the gym.  Felt pretty bloated and nauseous during the workout.  Squats were pretty difficult, I think my stance a bit wider than usual and I was going a bit deeper than I usually go.  Presses were pretty solid until the last set.  I did notice that my right wrist was quite a bit more bent than my left.  I also noticed that my right elbow was tucked in a bit more than my left.  I need to pay attention to my forearm and make sure that it is perpendicular to the floor from the front and the sides.  Still managed to bang out the Deadlifts.  I don't know if I'm arching my back, but I'm definitely not feeling it strain.  Pull-ups felt more confident today than the previous workout.  I tip-toed to the wide arm grips, hung from it, then started my reps with control.  Prone bridges were hard as hell; I did them for 60 seconds instead of 30.
