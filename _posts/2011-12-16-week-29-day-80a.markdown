Forgot that today should have been a B session.  Woops.

**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
1 x 235
3 x 270

Actually did 4, but I definitely did more of a good morning than a squat on the 4th rep.  Felt extremely heavy.  Left knee feels very unstable when locked out.

**Bench:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 75
3 x 95
2 x 115
1 x 135
**5 x 160 PR**

Felt pretty easy.  I had someone spot me just in case.

**Power Clean:**

5 x Bar x Clean shrugs
5 x 65 x Clean shrugs
5 x Bar x Front squats
5 x 65 x Front squats

2 x 6 x 65 x Power Clean

I recorded myself doing the cleans and I quickly noticed I was doing them wrong.  I was using my arms to clean instead of shrugging.

**Accessories:**

9/3/2 x BW + 15 lbs - Last 2 sets were extremely difficult.  Felt like I was very fatigued.  Could have rested more.

4/7/4/8/4/7/4/8 spd HIIT - Felt pretty easy.  My heart rate dropped back down recovered pretty quickly.  High intensity interval heart bpm was around 180.  Recovery heart bpm dropped back down to around 155-165 within the 1.5 minute rest.  Recovering faster than before.
