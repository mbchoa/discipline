I am making another attempt at trying to keep track of what I eat.  I think now more than ever is the most appropriate time to start doing this because I feel I have reached the point where I can intuitively know if I'm eating enough and not eating enough and see immediate results from it.  By keeping a log and tracking what I consume daily, I think I'll have an even better grasp of the results of my performance in the gym (good / bad workout) and I can better gauge if I am consuming too much or too little.  My weight has for the better part of the last 2 months, plateaued around ~177-180 lbs.  My new bulk goal for the next 3 months is trying to get my weight up to 185 - 190 lbs with < 18% body fat.

I haven't been eating as much as I want to because I've definitely gained a bit more than I want to in body fat and so I've reduced my caloric intake.  To get to my new bulk goal, caloric excess is a must.  Therefore, in order to offset excessive fat gain, I'm going to introduce HIIT post workout.  In addition, I'm going to start doing some conditioning through boxing once a week.
