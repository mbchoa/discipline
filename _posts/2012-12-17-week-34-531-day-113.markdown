Pressing wasn't too bad.  Feel like I'm straining my right wrist- bar rolling back into my fingers.  Other than that, it felt pretty easy.  I think I need to try and exert myself more on the final, top set.  Did some more pressing afterwards, specifically, decline and incline benching.  I probably should invest more time in doing some more dipping...
