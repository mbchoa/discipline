**Weight:  181.2**

**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 175
3 x 195
2 x 215
1 x 235
**5 x 250 PR**

Another PR, I'll have to get my camera, but I really think I'm getting pretty good depth on the reps.  I definitely notice that on the last 1 or 2 reps that I may be leaning too far forward and doing a semi good morning.

**Bench:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 85
3 x 105
2 x 125
5 x 145

Had an even narrower grip than usual.  Feel like I may have tweaked my right shoulder a bit much.  Still relatively easy.

**Clean Progression:**

****5 x 3 x 95 x Clean shrugs
5 x 3 x 65 x Front Squats

**Accessories:**

8/4/3 x BW + 15 lbs - Dips felt very heavy, tweaked right shoulder didn't help much.  I'll stick with this weight.  With this and bench poundages going up, I think this will progressively become more more difficult.

2 x 1.5:1 rest:work HIIT @ 4/7/4/8 speed - A tiny bit harder than the previous HIIT workout on Monday.
