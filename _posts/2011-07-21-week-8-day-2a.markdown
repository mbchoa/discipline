Squats were heavy, but I finished.  Stalled on the bench for the second time.  I don't know what's happening, but it seems like I'm getting weaker.  My right arm is, again, straining quite a bit more than my left arm.  I don't know what it looks like but I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong.  I think I'm starting to jerk and left my back up on my rows.  Need to make sure I'm maintaining strict form.
