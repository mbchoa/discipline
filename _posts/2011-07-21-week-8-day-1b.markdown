Forgot to post Monday's workout.  Stalled on the Press already.  I've decided to move squat walkouts to the end of the session to give the remainder of lifts as much energy as possible.  Squat walk outs take a heavy toll on my upper back and traps so I think moving this accessory exercise will help me get my Press up to par.

Deadlifts were heavy as hell.  I'm pretty sure I rounded my back on the last 2 or 3 reps of the workset.  I think I'm going to go up in 5 lb increments from now on.
