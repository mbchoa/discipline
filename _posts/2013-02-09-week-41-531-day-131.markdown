**Cycle #4
****Week 2 Day 3**

**Warm-up Bench:  **5x70, 3x85, 3x105**
5/3/1 Bench:  **5x120, 5x135, 6x155
**Dips:  **5/5/4**
****DB Fly: **4x12x15lb**
Tricep Extensions:  **4x15x40lb**
DB Bench:  **3x12x30lb + 12x25lb
**Conditioning:  **3.0 spd walk 1mile

Bench was pretty good.  Warm-up sets and first two core sets were fairly easy.  Grinded out the 6th rep, but my form was definitely not on par.  Felt like my right arm/lats were working harder than my left.  Managed to get some conditioning in and did about 20 minutes of 3.0 spd walking for 1 mile.
