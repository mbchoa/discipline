**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
1 x 235
**5 x 260 PR**

This was heavy as hell.  My left knee was feeling very shaky, unstable.  Forgot to bring my camera; really could have used it to see if my form was terrible which it felt like it was.

**Bench:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 95
3 x 115
2 x 135
5 x 155

Pretty heavy.  Form was not stellar.  Noticed that I wasn't tucking my left elbow.  Load was shifting to the right arm.

**Power Clean Progression:**

2 x 5 x 65 x Clean shrugs
3 x 3 x 95 x Clean shrugs

2 x 5 x 65 x Front squat
3 x 3 x 95 x Front squat

**Accessories:**

9/5/3 x BW + 15 lbs Dips - Pretty difficult
