**Cycle #6
Week 4 Day 4**

Been very lackadaisical with posting my workouts.  This will have to change for the next cycle.  I felt invigorated to get stuff done today and wasn't too happy about passing off doing the deadlifts this past Friday.  I've come to grips with the fact that consistency is an ongoing struggle that I'll probably be butting heads with for a long, long time.  It's a matter of training myself to get the better of it one day at a time.

**5/3/1 Deadlift:  **5x120, 5x150, 5x180
**BBB Deadlift:  **3x10x150
**Sit-ups:  **40/30/25

Learned a lot of stuff today from some older and significantly wiser men.  Knowledge and theory are wonderful foods for thought, but has no effect on your own or anyone else's life without it's appropriate application.  I have a ton of reading to do.
