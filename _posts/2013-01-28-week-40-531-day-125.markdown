Last week was unintentional deload week.  So much for "skipping" it last week.  Again, struggling with getting myself up in the morning to hit the gym.  Lack of discipline, not eating right, sleeping too much.  Also, thinking of restarting Squats cold.  Left knee doesn't seem like it's getting any better and I think my form is going down the crapper from the gym-going inconsistency.
