**Cycle #3**

Deload week.  Almost done with the 3-month challenge.  Thinking back retrospectively, doing the challenge after coming off of a fairly rigorous 11 weeks of MadCow may not have been the best decision.  But, no regrets, I've made some decent gains in the first 3 cycles as a result.  I'm hitting PRs on the press and bench which I'm very pleased with.  Deadlift and Squat poundages are getting very close to my previous PR numbers.  Compared to the last cycle, I think I've done much better.  I think my focus for the next cycle is my nutrition.  If I want to progress with heavier poundages on the bar, I need to get my eating habits up to par.

**Press:**  5x45, 5x55, 5x65

Very easy.  Flared elbows out a bit early.  Right rotator cuff felt it- it had the same sensation close to when I nearly popped my shoulder out from my previous shoulder injury- was a tad bit scary.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Bench Press**: 3x10xBar + 3x10x115, 2x8x115

I think I rushed these a bit much.

**Chin-ups:  **5/4/4/3/3

Felt very strong on the first set.  I'm going to try for 6 next time.

**Curls**:  3x10x40 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x35 + **Face pull: **3x10x25

**Treadmill:  **
