2nd stall on the squats.  I was a lot more mentally prepared for the squats despite me stalling on them.  Presses were a bit easier and managed to get passed my previous stall weight.  I'm not sure if I was cheating or not, but I was bouncing the weight off my chest on each rep.  I was not, however, performing a push press; I kept my knees perfectly rigid.  I did find myself arching my back quite a bit more though on the more taxing reps.  It would definitely help if I can see how much I'm arching my back when my shoulders begin to give out.  Deadlifts were pretty easy.  I switched my alternating grip position from my previous deadlift session- Palm up on the right hand.  I used alternating grip on the work weight and the warm-up set right before the work weight.  I think I rounded my back slightly on the last few reps of my deadlift workweight, felt it it my back after.
