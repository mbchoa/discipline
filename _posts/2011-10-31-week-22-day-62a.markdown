**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 135
3 x 155
1 x 175
3 x 5 x 185

Decided to use a small seat to make sure posture was alright.  Compared to squatting without the seat, I noticed I was probably going down farther than needed without the seat.  Felt my quads being worked a bit more.

**Bench:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 55
3 x 75
2 x 95
3 x 5 x 115

Last set was somewhat difficult.  I didn't use a powerlifter arch so I may have been using more of my shoulder than I wanted to.

**Rows:**

5 x 95
3 x 5 x 115

These were very easy.

**Accessories:**

4/7/4/8/4/7/4/8 - Had much more stamina for this session's HIIT.  I managed to do 2 complete sets of 4-7-4-8.

3 x BW + 5lbs Weighted Dips - Managed to crank out 11 reps on the first rep with 5 lbs added to my bodyweight.

3 x 10 x 12.5 Reverse crunches - Pretty easy.  I think I'm supposed to be doing 12-15 reps instead of just 10.
