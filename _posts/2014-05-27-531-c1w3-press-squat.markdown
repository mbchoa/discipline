Memorial Day Monday, missed my Press workout so I decided to combine my Monday and Tuesday (Press and Squat) sessions into one today.  Surprisingly enough, the workout flew by pretty quickly.  The presses were still pretty easy.  I hang cleaned the bar up to the racked position for pressing on each set.  I usually go thumbless on the Pressing so, it was a bit awkward going from with thumb to no thumb.  The bench is still not balanced, my right chest/arm is working harder than the left.  Tried varying the grip width by going wider, but still had the problem.

Quickly afterwards, I did a few accessories for the pressing as someone was in the squat rack.  After that, I went straight into the squats.  A quick 5 reps of empty bar and then 5x40%, 5x50% and 3x60% of my 90% of 1RM for warm-up.  Managed to crank out 2 reps on the top set even though I'm supposed to stop at 1.  No belt!  The deadlifts were definitely lighter than when I last did the BBB last week.  In addition, less fatigue, I was able to crank out all 5 sets of 10 at 135.

I'm starting to eat big again.  With all this volume, it's no surprise that I'm much more inclined to eat everything in sight.
