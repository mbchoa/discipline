**Weight: **178.2 lbs
**Body Fat: **12.3%

**Squats:**

5 x 115
5 x 145
5 x 175
5 x 200
3 x 235
8 x 175

Not too bad.  Definitely easier than last week's heavy day.  I think my recovery's improved a bit.  I've been eating pretty well this week as well too so that may have contributed.  The last 8 rep is deceivingly difficult.

**Bench:**

****5 x 65
5 x 80
5 x 95
5 x 110
3 x 125
8 x 95

Again, I'm using my right arm and lats more than my left arm.  I think my right elbow is flaring out which is causing the load to be placed on my right arm.  I need to find people who have the same problem and figure out what they did to fix this.  Otherwise, the lift was still medium to easy difficulty.

**Rows:**

****5 x 65
5 x 85
5 x 95
5 x 115
3 x 125
8 x 95

Stupidly easy.

**Accessories:**

****BW Dips, 8/8/7 - Pretty easy.  Technique improvement:  turn wrists inward towards body to alleviate stress on the shoulders and put entire load on the triceps.  Basically have arms  as close to the body as possible.

BB Curls, 3x8x40lbs - Not bad.  Definitely burning a bit more on the last set, but not as bad as last week's heavy day.

Tricep Extensions, 8x35, 8x40, 6x45 - Ramped weights, triceps were spent by the 6th rep on the 3rd set, but otherwise still pretty easy.  I think in due time, my stamina will improve on this lift.
