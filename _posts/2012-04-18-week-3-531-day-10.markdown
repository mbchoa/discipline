**Cycle #1**

**Treadmill walk 5min + Agile 8  **It got pretty hot today.  I was sweating a lot during the agile 8.  Didn't get around to doing DeFranco's set of upper body dynamic stretches.

**Deadlift:**  5x110, 5x135, 5x165

These felt heavier than I expected them to be.  Really felt the burn when I squeezed everything hard at the top.  A little bit of lower back strain felt.

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Squat**: 5x10x135

As usual, deadlift+squat days suck...a lot.  I'm simply not accustomed to the high intensity squatting.  First 2 sets were easy, but cardiovascularly, I was pretty spent.  Took ample rest between each set afterwards.  I also didn't eat before lifting- I had left work early and wanted to hit the gym early so I could find a parking spot when I got back home.

**Ab Wheel**:  10/10/8/5/2

I was pretty much spent by the time I got to these.  Fatigue set in and I couldn't keep a rigid lower back.  I felt my lower back buckling and entering an unfavorable lordotic position.  I've already had issues with this in the past and so I chose not to exert myself too much.  Nonetheless, still got a fairly good core workout.

**Additional Notes:**

**Did not eat my 4th meal prior to the exercise.**
