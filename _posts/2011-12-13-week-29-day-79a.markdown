**Squat:**

5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
1 x 235
**5 x 265 PR !!!**

Got another PR.  I'm not sure if I went low enough on the 4th rep.  My camera ran out of memory when trying to film just the first warm-up weight.  Going for 1.5xBW next workout and hopefully I can sort out the camera issue by then.

**Bench:**

****2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 75
3 x 95
2 x 115
1 x 135
3 x 160

Stalled hard on the bench.  Didn't feel confident with the lift.  Should definitely get a spotter next time to improve confidence and give the lift all I've got.

**Rows:**

****5 x 95
3 x 115
5 x 135

People using the rack, so I couldn't get my cleans in.  Decided to do some rows, felt a bit heavy for the weight.  **Squeeze the bar hard before lifting**.  This causes the lats to contract.  Promotes less jerking by using controlled lift as opposed to using jerk momentum to get the weight up.  Makes the muscles work harder.

**Accessories:**

10/5/3 x BW + 15 lbs Dips - Pretty hard, going to go up to 17.5 next A session.

3 x 12 x 7.5 lbs Reverse crunches - Tried doing dragon flags before this.  The negative wasn't too bad, but the positive was impossible to do.  I think I might start doing some additional core exercises to get me to dragon flagging.
