**Squat:**

5 x 135
5 x 165
5 x 195
5 x 230
5 x 260 (belt)

The 260 was much harder than last Friday's 265 triple.

**Bench:**

5 x 70
5 x 90
5 x 105
5 x 125
5 x 140

Stopped doing it the Mr. Tate way and went back to doing them Rippetoe style.  My grip is a grip width wider on both sides.  I still lifted my chest a bit, and shrugged to engaged my traps.  Not sure if this is entirely correct form.  The norm would be pinch the shoulder blades together.

**Rows:**

5 x 70
5 x 90
5 x 105
5 x 125
5 x 140
