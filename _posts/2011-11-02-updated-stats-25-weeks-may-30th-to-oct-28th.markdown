Weight:  180.2

**PRs:**

Squat:  240 lbs
Bench:  155 lbs
Deadlift:  290 lbs
Press:  87.5 lbs
Rows:  160 lbs

I'm very pleased with my squat and deadlift.  My bench got back up to where I left off with before restarting my SL routine.  The press has not moved much in the 20+ weeks I've been well...pressing.  I definitely think the extra HIIT after the sessions are taking some toll on my recovery times, especially my squats.  I want to break through my plateaus, especially with my press.
