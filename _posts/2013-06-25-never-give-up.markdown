I am appreciative for the young men who attended today's region Gajokai meeting.

I am appreciative for those who reached out to me and gave me the opportunity to stand up in my practice.

I am appreciative for having the financial fortitude to afford paying for a car.

I am appreciative for a fellow YWD and her family for having a friend and I visit their home in the morning to do morning gongyo.

I am appreciative for the guidance I receive from seniors in faith.
