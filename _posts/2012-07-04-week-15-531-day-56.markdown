**Cycle #4**

**Deadlift:  **5x120, 5x150, 3x175 + 5x205, 3x230, **10x260 Rep PR**

I don't know what to say.  It seems almost fantastical that I actually cranked 10 out.  Determination and putting that number in your head really does wonders.

**BBB **Deadlift**:  **5x10x135

Messed up.  I wrote down cycle #1 BBB deadlift numbers.  And here I was thinking things were getting easier.  Go brain farts.

**Core:**

10 x 10lb Weighted Situps
15 x Ab Wheel Rollouts
25 x 25lb Side Bends
5 x10 x Lying Leg Raises
