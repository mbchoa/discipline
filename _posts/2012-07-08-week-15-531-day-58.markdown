**Cycle #4**

**Squat:  **5x125, 5x155, 3x185 + 5x210, 3x240, 4x270

I was pretty disappointed that I couldn't get 5 out of the top set.  I was actually going for more, but I couldn't finish the 5th rep.

**BBB **Squat**:  **10/8/6/6/5 x 145

I didn't use my belt on these sets.  I probably should have.  My legs were just dead after the 5/3/1.

**Core:**

10 x 10lb Weighted Situps
25 x 25lb Side Bends
10 x Lying Leg Raises

**Conditioning:**

1 mile at 2.5 spd
