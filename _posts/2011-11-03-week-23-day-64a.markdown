**Squats:**

5 x Bar
5 x 135
3 x 155
2 x 175
3 x 5 x 195

Squats were really good.  Narrowed my grip width and made a really tight shelf for the bar to sit on.  Upper back was definitely getting worked more than usual.  Breathed into my stomach.  Split the floor apart, had a fairly wide stance.  Box squatted again.  I think I'm going to continue box squatting.  Had no back pain.  I'm just not sure if I'm going down enough.

**Bench:**

****2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 55
3 x 75
2 x 95
3 x 5 x 120

Bench was pretty easy.  Narrowed my grip and tucked my elbows.  Arched back sufficiently and pushed my legs into the ground to put the load across my upper back.

**Rows:**

****5 x 95
3 x 5 x 120

Pretty easy.  Pulled into my lower chest / abdominal area.

**Accessories:**

****11/4/3 x BW + 7.5 - Banged out 11 reps on the first set.  Pretty fatigued on the last 2 reps

3 x 10 x 10 Reverse crunch - Not too bad.  Core endurance has definitely improved since I've started doing core.
