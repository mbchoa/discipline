**Weight**:  185.6

**Squats**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x80 + 1x3x125 + 1x2x165 + 3x5x210

**Bench**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x70 + 1x3x95 + 1x2x125 + 5/5/3 x 140

**Pullups**:  2/1/1

Squats weren't bad today.  Had shorter rest periods today too compared to Wednesday's session.  Bench stalled hard on the last set.  Can feel my right dominant pressing coming out again.
I need to figure out how I can solve this...very frustrating.  Pullups were weaker today.
