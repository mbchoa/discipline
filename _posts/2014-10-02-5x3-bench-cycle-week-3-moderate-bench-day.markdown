Struggled with the incline bench press today.  Only right lats and upper chest were engaging.  Dumbbell rows were also a bit difficult.  Standing overhead presses were surprisingly pretty easy.  Seated dumbbell extensions were pretty easy as well.  Barbell curls were hard on the last set.  May have gone up to 50s accidentally.
