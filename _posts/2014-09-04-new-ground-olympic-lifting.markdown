I've been dabbling with olympic lifts, primarily snatching.  Right now I'm doing multiple sets of 2 rep from mid-thigh hang to high-hang and then the 3rd rep I snatch the bar overhead from mid-thigh.  All still with empty bar.  Today I loaded the bar with 2.5s.  I'm going to have to find a training regimen.  Also probably need to get some decent olympic lifting shoes for the raised heel.
