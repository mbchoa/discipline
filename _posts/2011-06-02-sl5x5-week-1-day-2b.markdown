First _actual_ day at the gym.  I forgo going on Monday since I went on a 18 mile mountain hike the previous weekend.  I figured I should give my legs some rest.  Today's workout was fairly easy, but still worked up a good amount of sweat.  Absence from the gym for nearly 6 weeks now has definitely taken its toll.  I'm experiencing a lot of lactic acid build up in my quads; I never used to have these.  My legs are probably still shot from the mountain hike.  Hopefully, my body will get acclimated to the routine within the week.

**Stretch:**

2 x 30 sec. Squat position static stretch

2 x 10 Leg Swings (forward-to-back, side-to-side)

1 x 10 sec. Shoulder Stretch

**Squat:**

Bar - 1 x 5

95 - 1 x 3

100 - 5 x 5

**Overhead Press:**

Bar - 1 x 5

50 - 5 x 5

**Deadlift:**

95 - 5 x 5


Accidentally did 95lbs on deads instead of 115.  Stupid.  Need to invest in a little notepad and write down the numbers.
