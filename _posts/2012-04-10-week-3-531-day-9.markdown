**Cycle #1**

**Treadmill walk 5min + Agile 8  **Tennis ball rolling wasn't as bad as in previous sessions.

**Press:**  5x40, 3x50, 2x60 + 1x70, 3x80, 1x90

Wasn't paying attention until I dropped the weight, but for some odd reason, I only thought to do 1 rep for the first set.  Brain fart for focusing too much.

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Bench Press**: 10xBar + 5x10x80

Right upper shoulder / traps were burning after the first 2 sets.  One thing I noticed is that I was tucking my right elbow while my left elbow would flare out.  I somewhat alleviated the problem by flaring my right elbow out a bit more.  What this introduced though, is stress on my anterior delts.  I think retracting the shoulder blades would alleviate this problem.  Only issue I have with this (as I was already doing this beforehand), is that when pressing back up, my shoulder blades eventually protract.  I think I need to fix this by not pressing all the way up to lockout.

**Lat Pulldown**:  5x10x35

Pretty easy.  Noticed that it's easy to jerk the bar to my chest.  Controlled contraction is important to avoid "cheating" on the lift.

**Curls**:  3x10x30 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x30 + **Face pull:  **2x10x30

Pretty easy now.  I've gotten used to the extra assistance work.

**Treadmill walk 1 mile @ 3.0 speed**
