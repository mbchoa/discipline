Today was pretty grueling.  Tried to maintain correct posture on the squats.  I'm noticing that I'm dropping the left side a bit.  Also the bar is creeping up causing my chest to cave in instead of being open.  Deadlifts were difficult today.  Was really focusing on form and technique.  A CSCS guy doing some shrugs complimented me on my form, woot!  No conditioning today, I was pretty spent after the session.  Legs were still pretty sore from the hill sprints and squats from Tuesday.  Pecs were also pretty sore from bench day.  The DB Flys definitely helped with engaging more pectoral muscles, woot again!
