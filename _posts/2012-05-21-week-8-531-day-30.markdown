**Cycle #2**

**Squat:**  5x110, 5x140, 5x165

I banged out these reps pretty quickly.  Each rep I paused in the hole for about half a second.

**Boring But Big 60%**

**Deadlift:  **5x10x170

Decided to go with about shoulder width stance.  Felt different that when I lifted previously with narrow stance.  I imagined pushing my heels through the ground.  Scraping the shins really suck a lot.
