Good and bad parts of the session.

The bad.  Couldn't meet my reps on the first set of the squat and bench.  
For the squat, I went raw, no belt.  Surprisingly, I felt pretty strong. I thought the bar would just flatten me.  The bench was technique deficiency and lack of rest time.  Proof of this is I was able to do 5 reps easily on the last set.

The good.  I did squat raw.  I've been belting up on the top set of the work set for the last couple of workouts now.  I had some hesitation going into it without a belt, but my core held up much better than I anticipated.
