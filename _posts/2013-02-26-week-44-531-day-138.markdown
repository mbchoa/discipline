**Cycle #5
Week 1 Day 2**

**Warm-up Squat:  **5x100, 3x125, 3x150**
5/3/1 Squat:  **5x165, 5x190, 5x215

No time for boring but big, but nonetheless, the top set was pretty brutal.  Only 5 reps of 215 and I was having a tremendous amount of difficulty.  Lack of volume training from the bodybuilder assistance scheme has definitely caused my strength to go down considerably.  That and the inconsistent squatting/deadlifting.  Other than that, the squats felt very good tight.  I kept my trap shelf very tight, avoiding the bar to move up on the way down.  In addition, I also tried to "snap" the bar over my upper back and this gave me a superbly stable shelf on my upper back.  This was also very taxing on me as I was essentially squeezing my lats, and entire upper back and traps really hard.
