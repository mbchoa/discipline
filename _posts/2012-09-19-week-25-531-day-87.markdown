**Cycle #6
****Week 4 Day 1**

**5/3/1 Press:  **5x50, 5x65, 5x75**
**

Fairly easy.  Focused on form.  While perusing the net, I found this nifty article by Bill Starr on the overhead press.  [http://startingstrength.com/articles/stronger_press_starr.pdf](http://startingstrength.com/articles/stronger_press_starr.pdf)  Surprised me when he mentioned that dips is king when talking about developing overhead pressing strength.  I think...I might switch up the assistance between bench and press day.

**BB Assistance:**

DB Military Press:  10x30 + 10x35 + 10x40 + 9x45
Barbell Curl:  2x10x30lb + 2x10x40lb
Side Laterals:  2x10x10lb
Rear Laterals:  2x10x10lb
Preacher Curl:  4x10x45lb

**Conditioning:**

15 min. treadmill @ 3.0 spd
