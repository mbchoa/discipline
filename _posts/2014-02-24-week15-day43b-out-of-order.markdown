**Weight: **191.4 lbs

Three gentlemen were using the squat rack doing quarter squats.  So, I went ahead and started doing my shoulder movements.  Finished, but they still weren't.  What to do, what to do?  I went ahead and did some incline dumbbell presses and high rep dumbbell rows.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x8x15
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x8x15

**Incline DB Press:  **3x8x45
**DB Rows:  **2x15x40

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x135 + 3x155 + 2x175 + 1x200 + 1x225 + 5x240

These were absolutely brutal.  I was spent after the 4th rep on the top set, but I really didn't want to stall again so I grinded out the last rep.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 3x165 + 2x185 + 1x205 + 1x25 + 5x250

These were pretty difficult today.  My ramp percentages jumped a bit more than usual.  I felt like I was expending too much energy doing the warm-ups.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  10/10/4
Chin-ups:  2/2/1

Sticking with dips and chin-ups for the accessories.  I get the most bang for the buck regarding many body parts being worked with these.  The only thing missing here is some more ab and lower body accessories.  I think I can get away with forgoing lower body accessories with the heavy squatting and deadlifting.  More ab work would definitely help though.

**Conditioning:
**Treadmill: 10 minutes - alternating 30 sec. @ 3.2 spd / 30 sec. @ 5.5spd

Decided to start doing a little conditioning post everything.  I took this one from Jim Wendler's 52-question Q&A in his 5/3/1 program.  Treadmill isn't really my cup of tea, but I have yet to find a decent hill around me (and near work).  I adapted this one and extended the "sprint" intervals from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.  The same goes for the rest periods- 10 to 30 seconds.  It's a bit of a hassle to constantly raise and lower the treadmill speed every 8 second or so.  Calves got sore pretty quickly.
