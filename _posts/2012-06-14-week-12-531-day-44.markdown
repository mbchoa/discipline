**Cycle #3**

**Deadlift:**  5x115, 5x140, 5x175

Lifts felt good.  The triple was definitely a struggle.  Didn't keep the bar close on the first set.  The business socks are helping a bit.  I might look into investing in some thicker ones to protect my shins better.  I'd rather not have to think about my shins when I'm pulling.

**Boring But Big**

**Squat**: 10/10/8/6/5/7 x 135

Lower back was bothering me a bit.  May have rushed a bit since the weight was significantly lighter.

**Ab Wheel**:  10/6/5/4

Squats left me pretty dead at this point.  Core was definitely spent, I couldn't keep my torso rigid and felt like I was straining my back on the roll out..

**Treadmill:**

2min. warm-up
3 x 5spd / 2.5 spd @ 10% incline
