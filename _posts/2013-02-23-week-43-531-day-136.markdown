Warmed up pretty thoroughly today.  Two sets of leg swings front to back, side to side.  Two sets of fire hydrants and warrior lunges.  Did a few cautious rounds of box jumping.  I noticed that the way I jumped determined if my back felt like it was "seperating".  If I jumped from a standstill, it would bother my back.  If I prepped my jump by lowering my self a bit and engaging my legs, there was less back involvement- almost like I was jumping from my toes.
