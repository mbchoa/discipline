**Cycle #4**

**Deadlift:**  5x135, 3x155 + 5x185, 5x185, 5x215, **8x245**

This was the first time I actually went all out on the last set of the core lift and all I can say is hot damn.  All these felt great, no lower back strain, really felt it in the hamstrings and glutes when I squeezed up top.  Nothing beats the feeling of knowing you've actually progressed and as a result gotten stronger.

**BBB Deadlift:  **5x10x145

Like Wendler warned, these are nothing to "sneeze" at.  Got me breathing heavy.  I took about 15-25 breaths between sets to avoid resting for too long.  My hands stung from gripping the bar so hard.

**Hanging Leg Raises:  **3x5

These were a bit difficult.  I'm going to have to rethink what to do for the additional assistance here.  Doing actual hanging leg raises bothers my right shoulder.

**Conditioning:**

10% incline
2min. warm-up 2spd
5x1min. sprint 5spd
2.5spd until 1 mile

I'm going to steadily increment the number of sprint repetitions on my deadlift/squat days depending on how I feel at the end of the workout.  I'm aiming for at least 10, 1 minute sprints by the end of the cycle.  Afterwards, I'm going to increase the sprint speeds.
