**Weight: **181.8

Weight is dropping.  It's easier to bend down and pick up things off the floor.  Strength seems to be ok.  Definitely felt the impact most last session from the lack of eating.  It all comes down to planning everything out, cooking included.  Decided to hit the gym after work instead of super early in the AM.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x175 + 2x205 + 1x225 + 5x255

Loud exhalation on the 3rd rep.  Couldn't rerack the bar properly the first time walking the bar back in on the top set.  Made a point to only go down to parallel.  Used a bit more quads with a slightly narrower stance.  I was particularly determined to get 5 reps on these.  Biggest difference between today and previous session's squat was that mind set.

**Press:  **5x5x60

These got hard.  Shoulders fatigued very easily.  Lock felt a bit queasy on the right shoulder especially when I was grinding it up.  Bar was rolling back into my wrists.  Used a false grip.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 3x175 + 2x205 + 1x235 + 5x265

These were good, no lower back strain.  Alternating grip- pronated left, supinated right.
