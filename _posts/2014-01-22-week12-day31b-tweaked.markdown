**Weight: ??**
**Duration**:  11:30am - 12:21pm ~ 1hr 10min.

And when things were going so well.

**Squats:  **5x135 + 5x155 + 3x175 + 5x195 + 3x195 + 5x185

Someone else was on the squat rack with 4 more sets so I decided to work in with him.  He was using high bar squat and had pretty impeccable form.  I didn't want to inconvenience him so I decided to keep 1 45lb plate on and do a warm-up on that.  I proceeded to go completely off of my normal ramp sets.  It was at the point that I did my 3rd rep on the first work set that I felt something weird happen in the low back.  I've felt the same sensation before when I was doing plyometrics.  I got it checked out and X-rays didn't show any problem and I was told to keep off activities with low back for a week and...it went away.  Bending over, currently, has a slight twinge that is very familiar, but not as aggravated compared to last time.  I may get it checked out again.  Suffice it to say I'll probably warm-up considerably more to avoid this.  In addition, I need to work on more core to stabilize my torso and prevent it from falling forward.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x10x12
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x10x12

Instead of looking forward, I decided to, instead, look a bit down in order to put less strain on my neck.  These weren't as bad as last time.

**Deadlift:  **5x145 + 3x165 + 2x185 + 1x205 + 1x225 + 5x245

Pretty easy.  Rested plenty between last 3 sets up to the work set.  The lower back tweak had subsided a bit more by this point.

**Accessories:
**Preacher BB Curls 10x50
Incline DB Press 2x10x40
Push-ups 10/10/6

**Core:
**Elbow Planks 45 sec.
