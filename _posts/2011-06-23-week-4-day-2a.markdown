Today's workout was fairly straightforward.  Was in somewhat of a rush since I a graduation ceremony to attend afterwards.  I ate around the time I left for work and downed about 6 oz. of black coffee on the road to get ready once I got home.  Had to wait some 12 minutes for a guy to finish his sets on the squat rack.  Squats were fairly easy, felt unstable for some reason today.  I didn't have the same "tight" feeling I had compared to Monday's session.

Bench was fairly easy as well.  I feel like I'm using different muscles on my left side compared to my right side when doing the positive on the bench.  I gotta have someone record me to see how my form's looking.

Rows were easy.  Felt really good as I didn't use much hip drive.  Lift was steady, quick and powerful only using my upper back and avoiding my chest from lifting up.
