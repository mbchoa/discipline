**Cycle #4**

**Bench:  **5x75, 5x95, 3x110 + 5x135, 3x145, **6x165 ?? Rep PR**

The guy didn't understand when I said "don't help until I say so", so I'm not sure if I would even want to count 6 reps on my own.  Used a PL arch to really dig my upper back into the bench and engage the lats.

**BBB **Bench**:  **5x10x85

I maintained a regular width false grip on all sets.  No load imbalances, felt very balanced.  Also tucked elbows.

**Dips:  **9/5/3/3 + **Dumbbell Fly:  **4x10x15lb + **Tricep Pushdown:  **4x20x20lb + **Push-ups: **9/8/6/5

Used sort of a body-builder assistance on top of BBB bench.  I was feeling especially fresh so I did a tiny bit more work.

**Conditioning:**

****Treadmill 10% incline
2min. warm-up 2.5spd
2x5.5spd sprints
Walk remainder until 1 mile
