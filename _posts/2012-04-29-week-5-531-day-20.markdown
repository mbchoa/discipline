**Cycle #2**

**Agile 8 + DeFranco's  **

**Squat:**  5x95, 5x135 + 5x180, 5x210, 5x235

Haven't done high volume heavy squats in a long time.  Made sure to get the bar in proper low bar position.  Tried to control the negative part of the lift instead of dropping too fast.

**Boring But Big 60%**

**Deadlift:  **5x10x165

First couple of sets were easy, but cardio-wise got me breathing very heavy.  Last 2 sets were very easy.  Ample rest between earlier sets to get my breathing down a bit.

**Hanging Leg Raises**:  10/10/8/6/4

Used arm straps today for the leg raises.  I'm getting the hang of the exercise- definitely less swing.  I lifted my knees to my chest fast and lowered them slowly to avoid swinging.
