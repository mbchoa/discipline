Missed my workout Wednesday, I was extremely exhausted by the time I got home.  Today's workout was pretty disappointing.  Aside from being physically exhausted, I think my CNS has also taken quite a beating and it's taken a toll on my mental stamina.  Last rep of the 2nd and 3rd set, I was stuck in the hole for what seemed like forever.  Pressing was fairly difficult, it seemed like I was balancing left and right arm workload more than I did previously.  Grip was failing very hard on my workset; the bar was very slippery.
