Super fast workout.  Since I did the deadlift last workout, I switched the pulling exercise to the pullups for today.  The squats felt really good.  Also performed
the press with thumb around the bar instead of going thumbless.  Made sure to keep my forearm perpendicular to the floor and keep the elbows forward.  Pullups were
pretty difficult.  I was able to get about halfway up on the 2nd and 3rd sets, but didn't count them even as a half rep.
