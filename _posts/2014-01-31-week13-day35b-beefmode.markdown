**Weight: **185 lbs ??
**Duration**:  11:45am - 1:02pm ~ 1hr. 17min.

Time recorded is from when I started the pre-workout stretches until I started my post-workout stretches.  The Shoulder Shocker felt hugely improved, weights felt light for the first 2 sets.  Usually, I'm dying at the end of the second set.  Weight on the scale was at 187 this morning!  Getting into freshly washed and dried jeans was pretty tough, haha.  Legs are getting too beefy from all this squatting.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x115 + 3x145 + 2x165 + 1x185 + 3x5x205

Went down pretty slow to control the bar and prevent tweaking the back.  This makes it quite a bit harder since I'm increasing time under the bar.  These are getting pretty heavy.  Getting close to the magical 225, 2-plate squat.  I think I may incorporate some back off sets, very similar to Madcow's heavy day scheme or Wendler's Boring But Big accessory.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x10x12
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x10x12

Able to get to the end of the second set without feeling dead.  Felt a huge improvement here.  Doing the cleaning movement, I'm using a more explosive pull to clean the dumbbells up instead just using all shoulders.  It is a clean after all.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 3x165 + 2x185 + 1x215 + 1x240 + 5x265

Supinated left, regular right.  Pretty heavy, kept the bar glued to my shins.  Not sure if I was rounding, but my low back wasn't killing me afterwards.

**Accessories:
**Preacher BB Curls:  **14x50**
Incline DB Press:  **10x50**
Standing EZ Bar Curls:  10x40
Dips:  **12**/4/4
Seated DB Curls:  **10x30**
Pushups:  10/10/8

Cranked out some extra reps on the 50lb preacher.  I think once I get to 18+ reps on the 50, I'm going to jump up.  Went up to 50lbs on the incline db press.  These were pretty difficult, so definitely sticking to 50s for a while.  Dips are still improving, both in strength and endurance.  Pushups felt improved today as well.  Going to for 3 sets of 10 reps across next time.

**Core:
**Elbow Planks: **1min.**

Burn, baby, burn.
