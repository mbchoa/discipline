**Cycle #4**

**Bench:  **3x10xBar + 5x115, 5x130, **8x145 PR**

Grabbed another rep PR on the bench.  I wasn't all too confident going into the top coming from the previous set.  I may have been able to get another rep.  With a spotter, I think I need to be a bit less worried about failing and just do it.  "Going all out" as prescribed should leave no doubts in your mind that you went balls to wall on all your efforts.  That's the type of mentality I need to constantly refresh my mind with when I hit these weights.

**BBB **Bench**:  **5x10x85

It's definitely been some time since my chest was sore from benching.  I experimented a little with my shoulder positioning as well as grip type.  False grip definitely feels a bit more naturally when pressing the bar.  I don't use false grip on the top set; I'm too scared of it rolling off my hands and the bar smashing my face or throat.

**DB Rows:  **5x10x30

Very easy, very light.  I might do some db incline presses or bb incline presses here in addition.  I'd like a little bit of extra work on my chest.

**Conditioning:**

10% incline
2min. warm-up 2.5spd
2x1min. sprint 5spd
