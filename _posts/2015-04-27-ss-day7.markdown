**Squats**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x60 + 1x3x90 + 1x2x120 + 3x5x155

**Bench**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x50 + 1x3x70 + 1x2x90 + 3x5x105

**Chinups**:  3/2/2

Had slow reps on the last squat set.  Need to read from book to determine when I consider reps a stall.

Bench was a bit uncontrolled.  Didn't have good grip on the bench against back.  Need to read from
book about addressing this balancing issue.

Chinups were great.  Broke through previous PR of 2 and managed to grind out 3 reps on first set.
Going to shoot for 3 reps across.
