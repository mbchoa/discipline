**Squat:**

5 x 140
5 x 170
5 x 205
5 x 240
3 x 275

Stalled for the first time while on this routine.  The squat felt extremely heavy.  I definitely gave up early, my mind was already set up for failure.  I could have definitely cranked a 4th rep out if I really wanted it.

**Bench:**

5 x 75
5 x 90
5 x 110
5 x 125
5 x 145

Form still wasn't consistent.  Right arm wasn't dropping as much though.  Made sure to shrug my traps up.  Focused on engaging the lats and keeping everything insanely tight before each rep.

**Rows:**

5 x 75
5 x 90
5 x 110
5 x 125
5 x 145

Not bad, feel like I'm definitely incorporating a bit of hip drive now that the weight is getting heavy again.
