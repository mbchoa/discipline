**Weight:  **180.4 lbs ??
**Duration**:  1 hour??

Forgot gym shorts so...what did I do?  Buy a new one of course!  For $26!  At the gym! Woo!  Best money I've ever spent.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x105 + 3x125 + 1x145 + 5x5x165

Lower back did not feel great.  These are getting pretty heavy.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **2x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **2x10x10
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **2x10x10

Did these first since a couple was using the squat rack.  Tweaked something in the back of my neck during the first set of the lateral raises so I took a few extra breaths and massaged the area.

**Deadlift:  **5x125** + **3x145 + 2x165 + 1x185 + 5×215

Used the belt on the top set.  Low back was getting killed.

**Accessories:
**Preacher BB Curls 10x50
Standing BB Curls 10x40
Seated DB Curls 10x25
Incline DB Press 10x35
DB Press 2x10x35

**Core:
**Pushup-Position Planks 40sec.
