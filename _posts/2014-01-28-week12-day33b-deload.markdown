**Weight: **183 lbs
**Duration**:  10:55am - 11:55am ~ 1hr

My neck twinge and low back issues have gone away since they've cropped over the last 2 sessions.  I'm making sure to get a good warm-up in, jump-rope to start off, dynamic leg swings and Agile 8 as well as shoulder mobility work with the green band.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x115 + 3x135 + 2x155 + 1x175 + 3x5x195

These felt pretty heavy.  Definitely felt a lot of resistance trying to keep the arch in my low back and avoiding it from rounding.  Core strength plays a big part in preventing this.  Decided to knock down the top set scheme to 3x5 from 5x5.  I want to be able to continue progressing on the weight without killing myself.  With this, I can recover better, avoid injuries and technique breakdown.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x10x12
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x10x12

These felt a smidge easier than before.  No neck strain this time around.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 4x155 + 3x175 + 2x195 + 1x215 + 1x235 + 5x255

Pronated grip on the left, supinated, palm up, grip on the right.  Definitely felt pretty heavy today.  Of all lifts, I've never felt uneasy with the deadlift.

**Accessories:
**Preacher BB Curls:  10x50
Incline DB Press:  **10x45**
Standing EZ Bar Curls:  10x40
Dips:  **11**/4/3
Seated DB Curls:  10x25 (need to go up on these, pretty light now)
Pushups:  12/8/4

Bumped up the incline dumbbell press to 45 lbs.  Not bad, but did feel fairly heavy and struggled a bit on the last rep.  Dips were really strong, managed to crank out 11 reps on the first set, but was spent on the next two.

**Core:
**Elbow Planks 45 sec.
