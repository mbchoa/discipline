Switching things up ever so slightly.  Still 5/3/1 and also still BBB 3-month challenge.  But, switching out some of the accessories for more bodybuilding style lifting.  I still get my BBB in, but I'm tweaking the additional accessories to tailor more of a bodybuilding template.

The tweaked additional accessories were pulled from the bodybuilding template here:  [http://www.jimwendler.com/2012/09/531-and-bodybuilding/](http://www.jimwendler.com/2012/09/531-and-bodybuilding/)
