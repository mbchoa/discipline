Finally got myself back into the gym again.  It's been a solid 3+ weeks since I last lifted.  Decided to drop the 5/3/1 and go on a strength training program devoted to increasing my bench.  Pretty much another variation of 5x5 or even 5/3/1.  Program is periodized for 6-week long minimum.  Volume decreases over duration of program and resistance increases.  Program is as follows and can also be found at the following link:

[5x3 Bench Press Program: Increase Your Strength This Workout](http://muscleandbrawn.com/5x3-bench-press-program-workout-routine/)

**Weeks 1-2** –  Rep Work. You will try to perform 5 sets x 8 reps on the bench press, increasing intensity (weight) during the second week.



	
  * **Week 1** – 60% of your one rep max. 5 sets of as many reps as possible, but no greater than 8 reps per set.

	
  * **Week 2** – 65% of your one rep max. 5 sets of as many reps as possible, but no greater than 8 reps per set.


**Weeks 3-4** – Transition period. You will move to a 5×5 with heavier weights.



	
  * **Week 3** – 70% of your one rep max. 5 sets of as many reps as possible, but no greater than 5 reps per set.

	
  * **Week 4** – 75% of your one rep max. 5 sets of as many reps as possible, but no greater than 5 reps per set.


**Weeks 5 to completion** – You will begin the 5×3 portion of this program, and begin “auto-regulation.”



	
  * **Week 5** – 80% of your one rep max. 5 sets of 3 reps.
