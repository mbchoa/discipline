**Weight**:  186.3

**Squats**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x70 + 1x3x110 + 1x2x145 + 3x5x185

**Press**:  3x5x45 + 1x3x50 + 1x2x60 + 3/3/3/4/3 x 75

**Chinups**:  2.5/1.5/0.5

Squats were grinders. Going to drop down to 5lb increments moving forward.

Presses were pretty tough as well, accidentally did 4 reps on the 4th set instead of 3.  I'm at 75lbs and the lift is already getting
real tough.  But, with the lower rep target for each set, I think I can milk the 5lb increments a bit longer.  We'll see how the 80lb
feels on Friday.

Chinups weren't bad.  I think I need to get full range of motion, I don't think I'm getting my chin above the bar.
