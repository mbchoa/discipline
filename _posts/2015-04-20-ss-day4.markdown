**Weight**:  182.4

**Squats**:  3x5x45 + 1x5x50 + 1x3x75 + 1x2x100 + 3x5x125

**Press**:  4x5x45 + 1x2x50 + 3x5x60

**Chinups**:  2/2/1

The weight is beginning to feel heavy on the upper back.  Accidentally did 3x5 set/rep scheme instead of 5x3 on the press.
Chinups weren't bad, but still stuck on 2 reps on the first set.
