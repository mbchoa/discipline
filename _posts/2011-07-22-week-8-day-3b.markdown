Very heavy squats.  My lower back was killing me after the last set.  Last rep was insanely effing hard.  The pain went away after the workout and, currently, it's not bothering me at all.  Presses were super easy.  No squat walkouts means more endurance for my upper back.  Deadlifts were surprisingly easier than last work out and didn't round my back this time.  I used alternating grip.
