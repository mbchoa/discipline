**Cycle #5
****Week 1 Day 2**

**5/3/1 Squat:  **3x150, 3x175, 3x200  C1W1
**BBB Squat:  **5x10x115
****Core: **** 5xF Situps + 2x12 Lying Leg Raises
**Conditioning: ** 1 mile @ 3.0 spd + 5% incline

So, as expected, my squatting strength has definitely diminished from when I last did heavy squats AND I used cycle 1 numbers.  Also, trying something a bit new, using plates under my heels.  Few things that I noticed with this change is I'm not arching my lower back as much.  I feel like I'm using my abs a bit more.  Quads definitely got more involvement.  Don't feel like I'm leaning over as much as before.  Stance is also narrower than my typical low bar wide stance squat.  I think this will help me avoid stressing my low back as much.

Boring but big was pretty difficult.  My legs were jello and felt like blown up balloons.  Did some more core work again.  Did 5 sets of sit-ups to failure.  I don't keep track of rep count.  Lying leg raises were fairly agonizing, I was still a bit sore from the previous day's.
