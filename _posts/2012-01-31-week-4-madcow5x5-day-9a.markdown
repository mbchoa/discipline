**Squats:**

5 x 115
5 x 140
5 x 180
5 x 210
5 x 240

Was a bit hopped up on the pre-workout.  Decided not to use the belt on the last set.  Butt rose a bit faster than shoulders on the last few reps of the top set.  Raising chest and driving hips really helps with cranking the weight up once I get out of the hole.

**Bench:**

5 x 65
5 x 85
5 x 105
5 x 115
4 x 130 Stall

Disappointed to say the least.  I don't know what the deal is with my bench.  Over at ironstrong, I've found another individual, johnnyboy, who seems to be exhibiting similar problems as I am on the bench.  The feeling I get when I lower the bar to my chest is that the bar shifts to the right, in turn, causing my right elbow to go down farther than it has to thereby causing my right arm to exert more effort to press the bar back up.

**Rows:**

5 x 65
5 x 85
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 130

Still fairly easy.  Definitely felt my shoulders and biceps working a bit harder when I kept my hips static.  I did this by lifting the bar without acceleration.  I noticed that when pulled the bar off the ground too quickly that I was actually using a bit of hip drive and momentum- this shortchanges the amount of work my shoulders get.

**Accessories:**

Weighted Situps - 12xBW, 12x10, 12x10, 12x15:  A bit easier than the previous situp session.  Was pretty fatigued 2/3 of the way into the last set though.  Abs got pretty sore an hour later once coming home.

Weighted hyperextensions - 10xBW, 10x10, 10x15:  Not bad, again this bothers my knees quite a bit.

HIIT - 9min, 2 sets:  Was pretty spent after 2 sets.
