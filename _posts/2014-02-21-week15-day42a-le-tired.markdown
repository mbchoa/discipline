**Weight:  **190.1 lbs

Feeling very groggy and tired post workout session.  One observation to keep note of is that I stayed up until 2:00 am last night.  I did, however, manage to wake up feeling pretty fresh this morning, despite sleeping late.  My legs had been suffering a little DOMs from the Wednesday workout and so I foam rolled them during the warm-up.  On a recent post, I briefly mentioned my past personal experience with enduring through the phase of lifting significantly high percentages of my training max on a regular basis.  I believe I'm encountering this stage again.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x125+ 4x145 + 3x165 + 2x185 + 1x200 + 1x225 + **3x240 (1st stall) **+ 5x135

Succeeded in legitimately stalling on the squat for the first time since I started lifting this past October.

**Bench:  **3x10xBar + 5x65 + 3x85 + 2x105 + 1x125 + 5x5x145

Used a powerlifter arch to ensure that I kept a strong stable upperback while benching.  The first set was a little nerve wracking.  The placement of the bar was not at the base of my palm and so my wrists were buckling against the weight of the bar.  I narrowed my grip a little, placed my ring finger on the knurling and placed the bar at the base of my palms to avoid loading my wrists.  A narrower grip helped alleviate stress on my shoulders.

**Rows:  **5x85 + 3x105 + 1x135 + 3x5x150

Last set felt the best, minimized the upward jerk.  I will stick with 3 sets on the rows.

**Accessories:**
DB Incline:  10x50 + 8x50 + 6x50
Wide Lat Pulldown:  10x70 + 10x85 + 10x100
DB Bench:  3x10x40

**Core:
**Elbow planks:  45 sec.

The whole body was shaking a lot from the get go.
