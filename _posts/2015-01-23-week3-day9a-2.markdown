**Weight**:  182.0

**Squats**:  5x5x90

**Bench**:  5x10x65

**Rows**: 3x10x85 + 5x85 + 7x85

**Dips**: 6/3/2
**Incline DB Bench (Left Arm)**: 15x25 + 8x25 + 7x25

Trying to address this load imbalance on bench pressing movements.  Decided to do an additional 3 sets of incline dumbbell pressing on the left arm.  Trying to figure out how to engage
my lats and triceps on the press.  The fatigue I felt was primarily on the anterior deltoids.  I'm hoping this will help even things out a bit.

Squats felt more comfortable on the knees today.  Added a slight bit more forward lean on some of the reps and tried to keep the back from arching too much.  Dug the shoulders
as low as I could.  Adjusted a few times mid set to keep the bar down as it was sliding upwards towards high bar.

Felt very comfortable with the rows.  I'm finally feeling the biceps get engaged on the lift.  Grip is narrower than what I had used in the past.  Made sure to keep my back parallel
to the ground and squeeze the shoulder blades together.  Grip was failing even when I was employing the hook grip.

Played around with the dips today.  Realized my shoulder doesn't much mobility when looking at how low I was going.  I get a big stretch already when hitting parallel.  Nonetheless,
I managed to crank out more reps than the last A session, so I'm happy.
