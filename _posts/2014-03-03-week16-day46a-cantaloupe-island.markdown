Squats were pretty difficult, but I managed to grind out the 5th rep.  Stalled on the bench again today.  Form is pretty inconsistent.  Still unbalanced load- right chest and right arm doing a lot more work.  Jerking a lot on the rows.  Dips weren't bad, a bit wobbly on the form.  Pull ups felt strong on the first reps.  I'm using wide grip on these.  No conditioning.

**Squats:  **3x5x135 + 5x150 + 3x175 + 2x200 + 1x225 + 5x250
