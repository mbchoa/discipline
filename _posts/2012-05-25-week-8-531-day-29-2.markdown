**Cycle #3**

**Bench Press:**  3x10xBar + 5x110, 5x125, 5x140

I keep forgetting to do additional reps on the last set.  Today's bench felt pretty solid- no load imbalance.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Press:  **10/8/5/4/4x75 +** DB Row:  **5x10x30** **

Press was pretty difficult- I couldn't finish out the sets except for the first.  I used a false grip.  The DB Rows weren't a part of the Press superset.  Instead, I incorporated it as the last exercise after the face pull.

**Curls: ** 3x10x40 +** Tricep pushdown: ** 3x10x35 +** Face pull:  **3x10x25

Up'ed the weight on the curls to 40.  I can actually comfortably do these now.  I could barely lift them when I first started 5/3/1.  Tricep pushdowns were still pretty easy, I went from 30 to 35.  Face pulls were pretty as well.
