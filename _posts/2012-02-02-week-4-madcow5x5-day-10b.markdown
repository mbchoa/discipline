**Squats:**

5 x 120
5 x 140
5 x 180
5 x 180

Not bad.  Was noticing again that my left side was dropping down a bit lower than my right side and the weight was rolling forward a bit.  I think this has to do with not shoving my knees out evenly with my right leg.  Mental cue once reaching the bottom should be "split the floor apart and drive your ass up".

**Press:**

5 x 50
5 x 60
5 x 70
5 x 80

Tried going for a more natural grip and widened it a bit.  Felt better.  Made me have a bit more control and felt like my shoulders were working evenly.

**Deadlifts:**

5 x 145
5 x 175
5 x 205
5 x 235

These felt great today.  Noticed that I was shrugging and rolling my shoulders back at the top.  Not sure if this is good or not, but felt natural to me in order to lock out the weight.

**Accessories:**

Situps - 30/15/16:  Did these until "failure".  I think next time I might change it so that I have to do as many situps as possible within a predetermined amount of time.  Doing this exercise to "failure" seems a bit ambiguous and form definitely begins to deteriorate rapidly once my abs get tired, aka my lower back starts to round lordotically.

HIIT - 3-7-8-3-7:  Legs were pretty beat by the end of these intervals.  I felt a cramp coming along on my right calf.
