**Deadlift:  **5x100 + 5x130 + 3x155 + 5x170 + 5x195 + 5x220
**BBB Squat:  **3x10x135
**Vertical Leg Raises:  **3x10

Started doing the [Boring But Big 3-Month Challenge](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_boring_but_big_3month_challenge).  I remember these squat/deadlift days now....  The sheer amount of volume from doing both exercises is unreal.  The "Boring But Big" assistance template is an extremely rigorous way of building real strength.  On top of that, it's really, really simple.  After performing the core lifts, instead of going to failure on the top set, the reps stop at 5.  And instead, 5 sets of 10 reps are done at 50% of 1RM (90%).  I remember very vividly the sharp increase in strength gains I was able to get from this assistance template.
