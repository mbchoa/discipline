**Squat:  **5x105 + 5x135 + 3x1160 + 5x175 + 5x200 + **7x230 (276.04 1RM)**
**BBB Deadlift 70%:  **5x105 + 5x135 + 3x160 + 10x190 + **9x190 + 8x190 + 7x190 + 0x190**

**Treadmill:  **2min. 3.0 speed + 4 min. 5.0 speed

Very grueling session.  Happy with the squats, I was able to crank out more than I was aiming for (6).  Stalled out hard on the BBB assistance deadlifts.  Fatigue got the best of me.
