**Cycle #5
****Week 1 Day 3**

**Warm-up Bench:  **5x70, 3x90, 3x105**
5/3/1 Bench:  **5x115, 5x130, 7x150
**BBB Bench:  **2x10x85 +** **3x8x85
**Tricep Extensions: ** 1x12x35lb +** **4x12x45lb

Pretty easy day.  Using right lats, and triceps more again.  Boring But Big sets felt really light.  I think the 2 month bodybuilder assistance isolation exercises contributed to overall increase in strength for bench.  I made the move to sprinkle in some hypertrophy due to the assistance being so easy.  I may or may not do this with the other core lifts, but I think I'm going to continue adding 1 or 2 post BBB hypertrophy exercises on the pressing days. Squats and deadlifts are fairly taxing on the body especially with the BBB sets so I think I'll forgo any hypertrophy after those exercises.
