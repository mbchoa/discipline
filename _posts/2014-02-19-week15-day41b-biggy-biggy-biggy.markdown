**Weight: **190.0 lbs

I've never been this heavy before.  190lbs is certainly a sight to see on the scale.  Good? Bad?  I'm not sure yet.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x135 + 4x155 + 3x175 + 2x195 + 1x215 + 5x235 + 5x115

Had some bit of forward lean on the last 2 reps of the top set.  I was trying not to look straight ahead as it would have put my neck in an awkward position relative to my body.  Instead, I tried to focus lower on the wall in front of me.  Most squatters tend to look up to keep their chest up- I used to do this as well.  However, this put my neck in a bad position.  With this in mind, keeping my neck in line with my spine proved to have been difficult in trying to maintain my chest and torso upright.  More core is definitely engaged when I position my neck this way.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise: **3x6x15
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x6x15

15 pounders were pretty grueling.  Took about 1 to 1.5 min. rests after the 2nd set.  Paused briefly between the lateral raises and shrug-clean-half presses to give myself a brief momentto get over some of the fatigue build up.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 3x165 + 2x185 + 1x205 + 1x25 + 5x250

Used the belt on the top set.  Alternating grip.  All the sets felt much better than before.  Definitely didn't feel as though I was rounding as much.  No significant lower back pain after the reps, so that's good news.  One thing I'm not too happy about is banging my knees up on the ascent and descent.  I'm trying to keep the bar close to my body, but at the same trying not to slide the bar down my leg.  I used a stance an inch narrower on each side and moved my arms closer in to keep them perpendicular to the floor.  I think this certainly helped so I will make sure to remember this cue when deadlifting next B session.

**Accessories:
**Incline Bench:  3x5xBar + 3x8x85**
**DB Rows:  3x8x50
Chin-ups:  3/1/1
Incline DB:  3x8x45

Did similar push and pull accessories for today.  I think I may swap a few of these for some more shoulder accessories and perhaps some low back strengthening.

**Core:
**Elbow plank:  1min. 10 sec.

Tough doing these today, whole body was a shaking.
