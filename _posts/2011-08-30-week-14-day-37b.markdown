First week back after rest week.

Squat technique:  keep the bar centered on my back.

Press technique:  lift weight evenly (watch the bar up and down).  Lower weight evenly as well.

Deadlift:  pretty heavy, but form was pretty solid.

Reverse crunches were easier than before with even a smaller counter weight.  Pull-ups were still fairly difficult.
