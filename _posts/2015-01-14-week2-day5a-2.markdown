**Weight:  **183.4

**Squats**:  5x5x65
**Bench**:  5x10x55
**Rows**:  2x10x75 + 3x5x75

**Dips:  **6/4/2

**Prowler:**  4 + 2

Prowlers sucked the life out of me again.  Pushed it with no plates on it this time and did 2 sets of runs.  4 reps back to back then 2 reps back to back.  Did 10 reps on the bench again.  The weight is still relatively light.  Rows got pretty heavy today.  Did 10 reps on the first 2 sets then 5 reps on the last 3 sets.  Dips were surprisingly easy today.  Managed to crank out 6/4/2 reps.
