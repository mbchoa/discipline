I've decided that I'd like to start an appreciation journal.  Basically, at the end of each day, I list a number of things that I'm appreciative for.  In addition, I'm going to simply pour my thoughts out onto the post about various things that has been on my mind.  This will mark my first day of the journal and I truly hope I can remain honest and consistent.  Much like my strength training journal, it's also my wish that this appreciation journal will allow me to expand and grow my life.

So, today...I am appreciative for:

1.  A selfless father who has literally dedicated his entire fatherhood to serving his family.  I have met no person like him.

2.  Being alive at this present time at this present place.

3.  Having amazing friends of faith through the SGI.

4.  Making it back home in one piece during the heavy rain.

5.  Having the opportunity to encounter Nichiren Buddhism in this lifetime.
