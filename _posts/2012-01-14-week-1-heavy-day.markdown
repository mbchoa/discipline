**Squats:**

5 x 115
5 x 140
5 x 170
5 x 195
3 x 230
8 x 170

Squats were feeling heavy already.  Used the belt on the triple.  My legs were still pretty sore from the previous day.  8 rep set was easy, but fatigue settled in on the last 2 reps; had to push hard.

**Bench:**

****5 x 65
5 x 75
5 x 90
5 x 105
3 x 125
8 x 90

Bench was pretty easy.  Noticed that I was lowering the weight towards my lower chest instead of higher up like I usually do.  I was also trying not to use a powerlifter's arch to get more muscle recruitment from my chest and triceps.

**Rows:**

5 x 65
5 x 75
5 x 95
5 x 105
3 x 125

Rows were very easy.   I narrowed my grip a bit, pinkie next to the knurling on the inside side.  I slowly pulled off the ground and then accelerated the pull quickly as I lifted up to my chest.  Pulls were a breeze and everything was good except I forgot to do the 8 rep set after my triple.

**Accessories:**

Barbell Curl:

8 x 40
8 x 50
8 x 50

Haven't done these in a while so I eyeballed my starting weights.  I haven't trained for hypertrophy since I last did Madcow so stamina was definitely lacking.  Had a good amount of fatigue by the 4th rep of the last set.  I'm going to stick to 40 lbs for all three sets for now.

Tricep Extensions:

8 x 30
8 x 35
8 x 40

These were easy.  I loved doing these when I did Madcow in the past and I still love them now.  I get a good pump and my triceps feel huge!  Very brotastic.

Dips:

7 x BW
5 x BW
5 x BW

These were pretty hard.  I messed up the order of the accessories.  I should have started with these then bb curls then tricep extensions.  Doing 2 tricep exercises back to back sucks.
