Been all over the place with my gym time.  Missed first 2 days.  Did bench day on Thursday last week.  Missed day 4 and did squat + deadlift workout the following.  Didn't do 3rd, top set, of squat 5/3/1 to save some juice for the deadlift (I like doing deads way more than squats at this point).

Laziness is getting the better of me again.  Really need to focus and get my ass up in the morning.
