**Cycle #6
****Week 1 Day 4**

**Warm-up:  **leg swings, box jumps

**Squat:  **5x115, 3x135, 1x165 + 5x185, 5x210, 3x240

I cranked back my squats since I haven't been consistent with them.  The top set was a real grinder, couldn't believe it, but it was very difficult to get 3 reps off for sure.  I'm not sure where I want to go with squats as I've been very erratic with them.  I think I might switch the days up so that I do squats earlier in the week to avoid missing them.  Probably switching up deadlift day with squat day.

**BB Assistance:**

2x15x180 Leg Press:  Haven't done leg presses for like over 2 years now.  These weren't difficult in the manner of maximal effort, but rather endurance.
3x25 Sit-ups:  Not bad, pretty easy.  Probably going to add some lying leg raises or crunches to work the lower abs.

**Conditioning:**

6min. Heavy Bag:  Just hitting the bags and working punching technique.  Gym was closing early so I didn't do the 30-30-30 drill.  Left shoulder hurts a bit mainly in the anterior delt area.
