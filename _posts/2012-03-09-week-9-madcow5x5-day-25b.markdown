**Squat:**

5 x 140
5 x 170
5 x 205
5 x 205

Legs felt a bit tight.  I think I needed to stretch a bit more.

**Press:**

5 x 55
5 x 70
5 x 80
5 x 90

Not bad.  Noticed on the 3rd set that my grip was much too wide.  Narrowing grip width helped engage my lats more.

**Deadlift:**

5 x 170
5 x 205
5 x 235
5 x 270

Definitely pretty heavy.  I feel like I'm using a bit more back than I want to.  The pulls felt stronger than last week's though.  I imagined pushing my heels through the ground and keeping the bar close to my body to avoid creating a longer lever arm and stressing my lower back.
