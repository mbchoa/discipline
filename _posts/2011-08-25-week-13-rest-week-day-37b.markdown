Pretty easy day again.  Tweaking my lower left back because I'm not focusing on the way down.  Noticed that looking straight ahead and not at my reflection helped a lot.  Press was pretty easy.  Felt like I was using my right arm more thought still.  Deadlifts were considerably easier than before.  Technique queue, lift chest up before pulling.
