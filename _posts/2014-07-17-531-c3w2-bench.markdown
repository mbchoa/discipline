**Bench:  **5x60 + 5x75 + 5x90 + 3x105+ 3x115 + 11x130 (180.06 1RM)
**BBB Press 70%:  **5x10x50

**Seated DB Shoulder Press:  **3x10x30
**Lat Pull-down:  **3x8x42.5
**Dips:  **5/5/4

**Treadmill:  **3.0 spd with 8lb kettlebell overhead

Pretty light day.  Dips were rough on the rotator cuffs.  A little shoulder impingement (hyperextension?) on the left cuff when I pressed up very quickly during bbb presses.  Did more shoulder work and did 3 sets of db shoulder presses.
