Time is flying by.  I'm starting my 2nd month of physical therapy.  The therapy will be more aggressive than my first month.  In other words, I'm going to be in a lot of pain most likely.  Right now, I can raise my arm just a tad bit more than 90 degrees from having them by my side without having to shrug my shoulders.

The physical therapist has assigned me some homework, woot, finally.  I've been waiting a long time for when I could start doing some strength and stretching exercises on my own.  There are 2 stretching exercises and 4 strengthening ones.  I'll post some pics and/or videos of the specific exercises later.
