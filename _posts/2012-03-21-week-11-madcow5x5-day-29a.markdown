**Squat:**

5 x 135
5 x 160
5 x 190
5 x 225
5 x 260 (+belt)

Took ample rest before heavy top set.  Wasn't bad at all.

**Bench:**

5 x 75
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 135
5 x 150

Pretty easy.  Took a good amount of rest time before the last set.  PL arched and it was pretty easy.  Also made sure to shrug up.

**Row:**

5 x 75
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 135
5 x 150

Pretty hard, but not freezing at sticking point yet so I'm going to keep adding poundage.

**Accessories:**

Weighted Sit-ups - 34xBW/22xBW/16x10/12x15
