**Weight**:  186.3

**Squats**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x85 + 1x3x125 + 1x2x170 + 3x5x215

**Press**:  3x5x45 + 1x3x60 + 1x2x75 + 5x3x90

**Chinups**:  3/1.5/1

Squat form on the last work set was pretty bad.  Definitely felt the back rounding.

Press wasn't too bad. There were points where I felt like I was definitely stuck.  Arching the back a lot, may not be good for it.

Chinups are about the same.  I haven't progressed on them in a while.
