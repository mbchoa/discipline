First day back hitting the iron.  Gym was pretty crowded for noon time.  Getting acclimated to the typical judgmental vibe from the regulars.  I did some extra stuff for shoulder, but I'll have to do a bit more research and see what I can do to alleviate the shoulder impingement and strengthen it with some extra shoulder exercises.
