**Cycle #1**

**Treadmill 5min. walk + Agile 8  **

**Squat:**  5x120, 3x145, 2x175 + 5x200, 3x230, 1x255

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Deadlift:  **5x10x135

These were considerably much easier than the previous week's.  These definitely get me gassed pretty hardcore though.  Realized that holding lockout position actually fatigued me more than I needed.  Narrowing grip also eliminated any source of lower back pain- instead really felt the work being done in my hamstrings and legs.

**Hanging Leg Raises**:  5x10

These weren't as bad as the previous week's.  I actually did all 5 sets this time, resting amply between sets.  Grip strength also got worked a bit, forearms were burning in the latter sets.  I reset myself by touching my feet to the ground and stabilizing myself to a standstill before each rep.  I slightly bring my legs back before each rep- probably will eventually lead to me swinging my legs up instead of using a controlled form.
