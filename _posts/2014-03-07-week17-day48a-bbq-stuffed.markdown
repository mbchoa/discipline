**Weight:  **187.6 lbs

Went out for a lunch to a BBQ joint with development team at work to celebrate our major software release.  Had a platter of pulled pork with a side of bbq beans and cornbread.  Super stuffed!

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x175 + 1x195 + 3x225
****

Decided not to go for my real target workweight.  Was short on time.  Will make an attempt at 5x255 come Monday.

**Bench:  **3x5x10 + 5x75 + 5x95 + 2x115 + 1x135 + 5/**4**/**3**/**3**/**3** x 150 **(3)**

Stalled on the bench again.  This is the third time.  I will deload 10% for the next bench workout which means I will do 5x5 at 135 lbs.

**Rows:  **5x135 + 3x135 + 2x135 + 3x5x160 **(1)**

Not sure if I want to keep increasing the weights on this as I saw myself lifting my torso quite a bit.  I'm moving closer towards doing an upright barbell row rather than a strict bent-over barbell row.  I'll consider this as a stall.  Stalling should not only consider failure to achieve a desired number of reps achieved, but also failure to maintain proper technique and form.

**Accessories:**
Pull-ups:  2x2 + 6x1
Dips:  3/2/2

Pull-ups weren't bad.  Decided to get to 10 reps total.  I was able to do 2 sets of 2 reps.  The remaining 6 reps were done 1 set at a time.  Doing the dips hit my right chest pretty hard.  My unbalanced load on the bench- causing me to work the right chest more- carried over to the dips.
