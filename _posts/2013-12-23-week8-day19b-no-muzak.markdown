**Weight:  **177.4 lbs
**Duration**:  53min.

December and it's 55 degrees out.  Start of the 8th week on SL5x5 and I've gained roughly 7-8 lbs of weight.  On heavier days, I actually sit a pretty 180/181 lbs on the scale.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x95 + 3x115 + 5x5x135

Not much shoulder pain today.  I think it's a combination of two things.  1.) It's really warm out so the joints were probably nice and loose.  2.) I kept a relatively high bar position with a fairly wide grip.  The downside to this, however...is that I was probably using my low back more than I wanted to- I felt it.  Inherently, with the way I'm using the high bar, I'm not able to keep my chest up as much as I want which inadvertently makes me "hunch" a bit, creating a greater moment arm from my hips and ultimately transferring some of the load to my low back.  My left knee also feels...tingly.  That's the best word I can use to describe how it feels after squatting.  It doesn't look or feel as if it's swelling, but it's just...strange.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x10x25
**Seated Lateral Raise:  **3x10x10
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x10x10

Since these exercises are primarily isolation and not compound, I do really well with the first round.  Afterwards, the fatigue build up and slow recovery just makes these super grueling.  I didn't have much neck strain like I did the previous time I did this.  Tried to make sure I wasn't jerking my head around and kept my head stable.  This is especially hard to do on the lateral raises.  For the half presses, I pressed a bit farther up where I was close to doing a full press, but not quite.  They were probably 85% to 90% from being a full press.

**Deadlift:  **5x125 + 3x145 + 1x165 + 5×185

These weren't bad.  I was definitely grinding the bar against my shins hard on the top set.  One of the employees from the front desk was looking around towards the free weights area, most likely from all the loud weight dropping noise.  I was fairly gentle with dropping the weight on the deadlifts.  I can only do so much before I hurt myself trying to lower the weight lightly.
