**Cycle #2**

**Agile 8 + DeFranco's  **Legs were sore as hell all day today.  Squats really killed 'em good.  Foam rolling was definitely painful today.  Glute tennis rolling really kneaded the muscles good.

**Bench Press:**  5x105, 5x120, 5x135

Felt wobbly.  CNS probably hasn't "woken" up.  Used powerlifter arch on the last set.  I focused on flaring the elbows on the right side instead of tucking to ensure balanced work between each side.

**Boring But Big 60%**

**Press:  **5x10x60 +** DB Row:  **5x10x30** **

Presses went really well.  I think I've finally nailed the proper technique on it to optimally press.  I think naturally, my shoulders want to rotate out at the top of the lift as if I wanted to  make my palms face outwards if they were open.  When I did this, I felt my traps engage and help me drive the weight upwards.  Not sure if this is the right way to do it, but the lift felt much easier.

**Curls: ** 3x10x30 +** Tricep pushdown: ** 3x10x30 +** Face pull:  **3x10x20

Easy work still.  I'm improving form on the face pull I think.  Hopefully, I can remember the feeling of the technique next time.
