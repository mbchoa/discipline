**Cycle #6
Week 1 Day 2**

**Warm-up:  **foam roll, leg swings, box jumps

Foam rolled the legs, did leg swings for the first time in a long time and man were my legs tight.  After 3 sets of leg swings, I did 3 sets of 5 reps of box jumps.  I'm going to incorporate some light plyo, speed/power work before my workouts to get my CNS activated.  I can't say if the box jumps helped me with my deadlifts, but I did feel much looser going into the lift.

**Deadlift:  **5x105, 3x135, 1x165 + 5x195, 5x225, **13x250 Rep PR**

Top set was just awesomely beastly.  I cranked out the early reps like it was a warm-up.  Chalked up the hands a bit- the bar was slippery and of course I had my lever belt on.  I took an extra breath or two in the final reps.  Extremely happy about these, no lower back strain, wasn't completely spent after them either, but I was definitely sucking in some air.

**BB Assistance:**

6/3/2 - Chin-ups: All of these were grinders.  My body felt heavy and my arms shut down quick.
3x15x35 - DB Rows:  Increased rep and weight made all the difference.  It was no top set PR squat attempt, but still pretty hard.  Gotta try me some kroc rows one of these days.
4x25 - Sit-ups:  Burned my abs pretty sufficiently.

**Conditioning:**

2x3min. - Heavy Bag:  3 minutes seemed like such a short amount of time to hit the bags. Boy was hilariously wrong.
