Last week of being in a sling.  Appointment next Thursday, so hopefully physical therapy starts then, but latest expecting to start PT is the following Monday, May 27th.

As far as my shoulder is concerned, mobility and range of motion has markedly improved from last posting.  Although, my range of motion is still definitely not 100%.  I can now lift my arm to about where it is parallel to the ground.  Any higher than that and it becomes very difficult.  I still can't touch my chest with my palm; it's sort of a test that I do every now and then to see where I'm at in terms of what I can and can't do with the shoulder.  For some reason, I don't have any sensation around my right anterior deltoid.  Just can't feel anything even when I'm pinching it.
