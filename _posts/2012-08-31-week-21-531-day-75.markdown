3 x 30-30-30 Heavy Bag Drill - Basically doing 30 seconds of normal heavy bag practice followed by 30 seconds of high knees with non-stop speed punching and then 30 seconds of all knock punches.  I initially did just 10-10-10 to test it out and wasn't bad except for the last segment when I was going all out- I got out of breath fairly quickly.  Afterwards, I did 3 sets of the 30-30-30.  My legs went out very quickly, doesn't seem like I have much endurance when I punched and actively moved around the bag.  I'll try to keep this up and work my way up on the number of sets- a set of 2 equates to a single round lasting 3:00 min.  I'd like to get comfortable up to 3 rounds of 3:00 minutes which should be 6 sets.
