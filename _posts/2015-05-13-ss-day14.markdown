Today was absolutely brutal.  First workout where I felt like I was completely spent.  Usually, I look forward to the deadlifts on deadlift day, but
it was just a daunting task ahead of me after the press.

Used the belt for the first time today.  They were insanely tight on me!  I guess the extra flab wasn't present last time I used the belt.

Top set of the squat was insane.  Almost stalled on a rep on the 4th rep of the 2nd set.

Presses were difficult from the fatigue I suffered from the heavy squats.  Many times I got stuck under the bar.  Moving the elbows forward and making
sure they didn't flare out definitely helped with pressing the weight up.

Deadlifts were a nightmare at the end of the session.  The previous person using the platform left the deadlift bar with 4 plates on there so I had to remove
each one off.  Just getting the equipment off the platform, alone, was a gruelling task.  Belt surely helped with pulling on the deadlift.  Still using
a regular grip.  Held lockout at the top of the last rep as long as my hands could bear.
