**Weight:  **182.8

Got to the gym pretty late, started lifting around 10pm.  Gym was pretty scarce, but still some people lingering.  Didn't have music, unfortunately.  Traps and upper back were still sore from the last session's OHPs.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x205 + 1x235 + **4x270 (1)**

Silent squatting.  Stalled.  Think I was using a bit much back, aka doing good mornings out of the hole.  Did 10 reps of external rotations with elbow by the side on my right arm to get my right shoulder looser.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x75 + 3x95 + 2x115 + 3x5x140

Need to really fix this, but I'm using my right chest more than my left.  Will need to read up on this.  Having no coach to look at technique makes correcting form difficult.

**Rows:  **5x135 + 3x135 + 2x135 + 3x3x170

Jerking on the 2nd and 3rd reps.. First rep is relatively strict.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  7/7
Pull ups:  3/2/2/2
Tricep Pushdowns:  20x40 + 7x50
