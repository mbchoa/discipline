**Cycle #3**

**Press:**  5xBar + 5x80, 3x90, **3x100 Rep PR**

I didn't use false grip on the last set.  I made it a point to keep the bar at the base of my palms.  Usually, as the weights go up, my wrists tend to buckle from my forearms' becoming too fatigued to support the wrists.  Hit a rep PR.  I was mildly happy about it probably due in part to being stuck on this lift for so long.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Bench Press**: 3x10xBar + 4x10x115, 1x6x115

Gassed out on the last set.  My chest was feeling especially fatigued.  The bar felt heavier than last week.

**Chin-ups:  **4/3/2/2/2

**Curls**:  3x10x40 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x35 + **Face pull: **3x10x25

**Treadmill:  **

3min. warm-up
2 x 1min. 5spd/1min. 3spd
