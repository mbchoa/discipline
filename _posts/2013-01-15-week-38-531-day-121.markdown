**Cycle #3
****Week 3 Day 1**

** 5/3/1 Press:  **5x70, 3x80, 3x90
**DB Military Press:  **4x12x25lb
**Side Laterals:  **4x12x10lb
**Barbell Curls:  **4x12x30lb
**Preacher Curls:  **4x12x25lb
**Conditioning:  **15min. elliptical

Press felt a bit better than usual.  Slightly narrowed grip and engaged and tight lats throughout entire movement really helped with the "wobbliness" inherent in my pressing technique.  Also, tried to keep the forearms and elbow underneath the bar instead of to the side.
