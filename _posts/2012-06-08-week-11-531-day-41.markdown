**Cycle #3**

Legs got some much needed foam roll love today.  They were fairly sore from Wednesday's squatting.

**Bench Press:**  5x65, 5x85, 3x100 + 5x125, 3x140, **6x160 Rep PR**

Bench felt great.  Knocked in another rep PR.  I got a touch of help on the last rep.  I squeezed the shoulder blades together prior to de-racking the bar.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Press:  **10/10/7/5/4/4 x 75 + **DB Rows:**  5x10x35

Presses felt very light today.  I managed to bang out 2 sets of 10!  Someone wanted to use the squat rack for squatting so I gave it up.  I, instead, got a barbell from one of the bench stations and basically cleaned the weight from the floor each time I started a set.  I think my grip was a bit wider than usual.  I kept my elbows directly underneath my hands so as to provide maximum power transfer to the bar.

**Curls: ** 3x10x40 +** Tricep pushdown: ** 3x10x35 +** Face pull:  **3x10x25

Curls were unusually difficult today.  Possibly from the extra pressing I was doing?  Tricep pushdowns and face pulls were still relatively easy.

**Treadmill:**

****2min. warm-up
2x 1min. 5spd / 1min. 3spd + 10% incline
