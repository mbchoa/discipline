I think I'm getting the hang of the Rippetoe squat.  I noticed a difference in the way the contraction felt when leading with the butt up.  Much more of my glutes and hamstrings
are contracting more.  I also felt like I was using more of my core to keep the trunk rigid against the load when going up and ensuring that I don't round my back going up.  I can
see why performing this method at heavier weights would allow easier rounding of the back if the shoulders and glutes don't rise at the same time.  If glutes go up before shoulders,
I would end up rounding and doing a good morning.  Vice versa and my hips and knees move forward and compensation for the weight will transfer load away from the posterior chain
to my quads.  More likely than not, my knees would probably buckle in as well.

Bench press was good today.  I performed them again with thumbs around the bar and ensuring that I squeeze the bar.  One thing that occurs frequently with this group is that the bar
sometimes rolls out of my hands.

Chinups were not bad.  First rep felt very strong.  Next time I'm going to rest a bit more between sets.
