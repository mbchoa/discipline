**Weight:  **183lbs

**Squat:  **5x105 + 5x135 + 3x1160 + 3x185 + 3x210 + 3x235
**BBB Deadlift 60%:  **5x10x160

The 2-punch squat/deadlift combo wasn't as crazy as the previous week.  I was able to finish all sets of the Deadlift, all sets with a belt on.  I don't think I would've been able to get through these without the belt.  Had 2 cheeseburgers and medium fries probably...15 minutes prior to entering the gym.  Really awful idea.  I think my form is off on the deadlift.  Shoulders are probably rising faster than my hips causing me to round the back.  Definitely felt some strain in the low back after coming home.
