**Weight**:  190.2

**Squats**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x90 + 1x3x135 + 1x2x180 + 3x5x225 (with belt)

**Press**:  2x5x45 + 1x5x55 + 1x3x70 + 1x2x85 + 2/2/1/1/1 x 100

**Deadlift**:  2x5x100 + 1x3x150 + 1x2x215 + 1x5x225

Back got beat up today.  Managed to finish all 3 sets of the 225 on the squat finally.  Noticing that I'm using a lot of quads on these.

Press stalled pretty badly.

Deadlifts were pretty hard.
