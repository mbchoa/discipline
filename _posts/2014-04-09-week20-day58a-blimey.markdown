**Weight:  **182.8

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x140 + 3x185 + 2x230 + 5x275 **(1)**

I'll say I stalled on these.  Better to admit to bad form than pet the ego.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x75 + 3x95 + 2x115 + 5/5/**2** x 145 **(1)**



Stalled again.  Right chest and arm still dominating on the press.

**Rows:  **5x135 + 3x135 + 2x135 + 3x3x175

First and second reps of the sets were good.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  15/7

Will start adding weights once I can get to 20 reps using bodyweight
