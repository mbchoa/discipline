**Cycle #5**

This past week has been pretty hectic with vacations and other obligations.  I missed my bench day and missed my squat day for the second time in a row (!!).  I think going to the gym in the AM is the solution to all these woes.

**Deadlift:  **5x115, 5x145, 3x175 + 3x205, 3x235, 8x265

The pull was pretty difficult today.  I think I may have used too much back and too little hamstrings and core as I got to the later reps.  I was too gassed by then.  It was a bit disappointing knowing I pulled 9x270 the previous week.

**BBB Deadlift:  **5x10x145

Pretty easy.  First two sets were a bit taxing, but the remaining sets were pretty easy.
