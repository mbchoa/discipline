**Cycle #3**

**Bench Press:**  3x10xBar + 3x115, 3x135, **7x150 Rep PR**

These felt great today.  I think I could have gotten another 1 to 2 reps.  I didn't use an excessive powerlifter arch.  Index finger was on the knurling.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Press:  **10/7/6/5/4 +** DB Row:  **5x10x35

Press was a bit harder today than the previous press.

**Curls: ** 3x10x40 +** Tricep pushdown: ** 3x10x35 +** Face pull:  **3x10x25
