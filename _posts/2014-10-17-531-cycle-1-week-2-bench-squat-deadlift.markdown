**Bench:
**10x65 / 5x95
3x115 / 3x125 / 3x140

Bench was pretty heavy.  Thumbless grip.  Trying to figure out why the load is more concentrated on the right arm.  Frustrating.

**Squat:
**5xBar / 3x95 / 3x115
3x140 / 3x160 / 3x180

Warm-up set was pretty painful for the right shoulder.  Will need to do mobility exercises prior to get the shoulders prepped for low bar position.  Interestingly...I decided to narrow my grip width by a lot and it actually lessened impingement on the shoulder.  Usually, it's the other way around due to lack of shoulder flexibility.  This also allowed me to have a more upright position and avoid doing a good morning on the positive.  Lowered lower back engagement so no sore back.

**Deadlift:
**3x135
3x155 / 3x175 / 3x205

Pretty solid on these.  Was very happy to do these again.  Deadlifts are by far my favorite of the compound lifts.

**Seated DB Press:  **10x35 / 8x35 / 6x35

Somehow did worse on these than previous db pressing.

**Chinups:  **3 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 2 / 1.5 / 1.5

Actually did the other 4 sets.  These felt very strong.  No doubt getting some help from the curls.

**Incline Bench:  **8x85 / 6x85 / 4x85

Struggled with these a lot.  Again, same issue with regular benching, right lats, triceps and upper chest were getting more strained than left side.

**Preacher Curls:  **3x10x40

Pretty easy, struggled from fatigue on the last set, but I think I can get up to 50 for next time.

**DB Bench:  **3x10x35

Pretty easy as well.  Not sure of the dumb bell path, was using a pretty narrow path.  May go a bit wider to get more of the pecs involved.

**DB Rows:  **3x10x45

Pretty fatigued by the end of the session, but managed to complete all sets.  Was jerking a bit on the last few reps of the last set
