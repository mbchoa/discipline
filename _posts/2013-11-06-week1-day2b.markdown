**Preacher Curls:  **2x10x25 + 8x35
**Deadlift:  **5x95

Not a bad day.  I took a bit longer today because...I didn't prepare and had no clue at all what to do in place of overhead presses.  Warmed up with some leg swings and static squat stretches.  I also did some band work for the right shoulder:  band pull-downs (blue), external lateral rotation (blue), internal lateral rotation (blue), rear deltoid raise (green).  I'll have to do some research and figure out a circuit of band shoulder exercises I can do, probably before I head for the gym.  In addition, I will should probably look for some specific weighted shoulder exercises to strengthen the shoulder a bit more.
