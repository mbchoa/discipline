**Cycle #5
****Week 3 Day 3**

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x80, 3x95, 1x115 + 5x130, 3x150, **5x170 Rep PR**

I went for a 6th rep, but got stuck halfway up.  I think I could have grinded that one out, but spotter took it from me too soon.  I had a pretty big arch and I felt it in my low back when I pressed back up.  Also, my right shoulder got strained somewhat.

**BBB Press:**  10/8/6/6 x 60lb

My right shoulder wasn't liking the additional work after the bench.

**BB Assistance:**

Dips - 10/6/4/3
DB Fly - 4x10x15lb
Tricep Pushdown - 5x20x20lb
Push-ups - 10/8/6/5
