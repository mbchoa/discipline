**Press:  **5x30 + 5x40 + 3x45 + 3x55 + 3x60 + 3x70 (78.76 1RM)
**BBB Bench 70%:  **8/8/6/5/4 x 105

**Squat:  **5x105 + 5x135 + 3x160 + 3x190 + 3x215 + 3x240
**BBB Deadlift 70%:  **5x10x190

Overhead and bench presses were tough.  1RM dropped on the press.  Couldn't finish out the 5x8 on the bench BBB.  Did squats with a slightly narrowing stance, engaged the quads a bit more than hamstring, but lift felt slightly easier.  Deadlift was grueling, but after 3 sets, muscles felt attuned to the stress and was able to continue and finish all 5 sets.  Rested for long periods towards the end, around 2-4 minutes between sets.  Hopped on the treadmill and walked for 5 minutes.
