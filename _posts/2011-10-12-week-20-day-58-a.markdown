**Weight:  178.8**

**Squats:**

5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
3 x 5 x 230

Pretty difficult.  Left knee was feeling awkward the entire day, probably because of the rain??  I'm getting old.

**Bench:**

****5 x Bar
5 x 95
3 x 115
2 x 135
3 x 5 x 150

First set of bench was pretty difficult.  I felt very unstable when pressing up.  I noticed that I was barely engaging my lats when doing the first rep.  My powerlifting arch was not being utilized properly.  I took ample rest between sets to make sure my arms didn't go anaerobic.  Stability, form and pressing strength was much better on the second and third set when I actually engaged my lats and upper back.

**Rows:**

****5 x 95
3 x 5 x 140

Rows were pretty easy. I noticed I had a fairly wide feet width stance compared to my grip width on the first rep so I narrowed my stance a bit for the following sets.

**Accessories:**

13/4/3 x BW Dips
10 min. HIIT - 4/7/3.6/8/3.6
