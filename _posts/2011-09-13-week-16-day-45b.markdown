Quick warm-up.  Squats were pretty heavy; I got pretty nauseous in between sets.  I think this may be attributed to my slightly lower calorie intake.  I also opted out of eating and waiting another hour before the workout because I wanted to give myself time to do some low intensity 20 minute cardio post workout.  Stalled worse than the previous press workout; probably due to my heavier squat (increased muscle fatigue on the shoulders).  This marks my second deload on the press so I'm decreasing the volume to 3x5.  Thus far, I've stalled at least once on every single lift except for my deadlift.  I pulled 275 today.  The first rep was remarkably easy, but fatigue set in pretty quickly albeit only pulling 5 reps.  Pull-ups were somewhat easier in the beginning, so I'm definitely getting stronger.  I decided to use 15 pounds for the counter weight for the reverse crunches as 17.5 was getting too easy for me.  And finally, I ran for 15 minutes at 5.5 speed.  My heart rate was around 175+ for the duration of the run.  I was fairly comfortable, but I hadn't ran for such a long time.  My left ankle was bothering me and my running form was wobbly as hell.
