**Squats:**

5 x 115
5 x 145
5 x 175
5 x 175

These were about average, maybe a bit on the difficult side.  I don't think my legs are recovering quite as well as I expected even with the drop of weight.

**Press:**

5 x 45
5 x 55
5 x 65
5 x 75

Pretty easy.  Form was a bit off when descending and repositioning elbows forward.

**Deadlift:**

****5 x 145
5 x 175
5 x 195
5 x 225

Pretty easy.  Did touch and go on the first rep, it was too light for me, so I focused on explosion from the bottom of each rep and performing them in quick succession.

**Accessories:**

****3 x 30lb Crunch machine - Using the machine felt very awkward.  The back padding wasn't stationary so I felt like I was losing workout efficiency.  I'm going to go back to old fashioned sit-ups on light days.

3 x 2 x BW Chin-ups - These were very hard.  Felt slightly light headed after first set.
