I'm nearing the end of my second phase of physical therapy (light strength training + aggressive ROM stretching).  I've still got some work to do to get FULL range of motion back in my shoulder flexion and external rotation.  Internal rotation is pretty back I would say 98%.  I still need another 6-8 degrees in my shoulder flexion.

As the title of the post says, my therapist is hoping that I will have full range back by the 15th of this month.  This leaves me 10 days left.  Those 10 days are going to fly by fast and I'm really determining that I get healthy completely by then.
