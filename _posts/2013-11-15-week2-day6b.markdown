Session went purdy smoovly despite only having about 3-4 hours of sleep.  Late night in the city.  I'm going to sleep like a baby after work.

Leg swings, static squat stretch, standing shoulder flexion against a wall, band work.  Squats weren't bad.  My shoulder is definitely more mobile compared to when I first started.  Tried low bar for a set, and had considerably less pain, but still reverted to high bar position for the remainder of the sets.  Need to start recording to see if I'm leaning forward too much.  Did some Preacher Curls while waiting for the squat rack to free up.  Did some incline dumbbell presses to finish off the session.  I did 5x95 as a deadlift warm-up, going touch-and-go.  The work set was not bad, but felt it a bit in the lower back, so I was probably rushing a tad.
