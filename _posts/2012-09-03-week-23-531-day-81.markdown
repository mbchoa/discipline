**Cycle #6
****Week 2 Day 1**

**5/3/1 Press:  **5x45, 5x55, 1x70 + 3x80, 3x90, 3x110**
**

Got the reps I needed.  Felt very wobbly on the second rep of the top set, thought I was going to fall backwards.

**BB Assistance:**

DB Military Press:  3x12x30lb
Barbell Curl:  3x12x30lb
Side Laterals:  1x12x10lb
Rear Laterals:  2x12x10lb
Preacher Curl:  2x10x45lb + 4x45lb

Didn't have time to get all 4 sets for each assistance.  The db military press felt much better compared to a standing military press.  Barbell curls were pretty easy.  Preacher curls were very difficult by the time I got to the 3rd set.  I didn't really rest between exercises so I was pretty much doing a circuit.
