**Cycle #6
Week 3 Day 3+4**

**Warm-up Squat:  **5x95, 3x120, 3x140**
5/3/1 Squat:  **5×180, 3×200, 3×225
**BBB Squat:  **5x10x135

**Warm-up Deadlift:  **5x115, 3x145, 3x170
**5/3/1 Deadlift:  **5x215, 3x245, 1x270
**BBB Deadlift:  **5x10x145

Probably not the best of ideas to do both squat and deadlift 5/3/1's on the same day.  Actually, thinking back, it was a terribly conceived idea.  I can't think of any other way to "make up" workout sessions though.
