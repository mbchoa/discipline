**Cycle #5
****Week 4 Day 1+2**

** 5/3/1 Press:**  5x40, 5x55, 5x60
**5/3/1 Squat:  **5x100, 5x125, 5x150

Holy inconsistency shazbot.  Yes, I'm still alive.  Missed working out for pretty much 2 weeks straight.  No boring but big today, no time.

Warmed up with some agile 8, leg swings, box jumps.
