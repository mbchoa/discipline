**Cycle #4**

Today was a pretty relaxing day.  Very light lifts.

**Press:  **5x45, 5x55, 5x65

Very light and relaxing.  Used a false grip.

**BBB **Press**:  **3x10x55

Got a bit of a burn on these reps.

**Chin-ups:  **5/4/4/4

Did these spread out even after the 5/3/1 and BBB presses.  Actually, also did some lat-pull down and bent over barbell rows here and there.  Tried to do some power cleans, but they ended up being very ugly- used a lot of my arm to pull and flip the bar.
