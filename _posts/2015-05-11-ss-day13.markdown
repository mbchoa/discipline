Tough day today.  Squat form felt pretty awful.  Either I did a good morning or my hips and knees moved forward, thereby losing all my hamstring leverage.
I think I will be using the belt on the top set moving forward.  Right shoulder rotator was a bit tight when getting under the bar.

Missed a rep on the bench today.  My form was way off.  My right arm was pressing most of the load and so it became too fatigued for the last rep of the
last set.  Frustrating.
