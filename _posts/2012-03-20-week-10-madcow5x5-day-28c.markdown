Squat:

5 x 135
5 x 160
5 x 190
5 x 225
3 x 260
8 x 190

Not bad at all.  Got plenty of rest time before the heavy triple.

**Bench:**

3 x Bar
5 x 75
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 135
3 x 150
8 x 115

PL arched on the triple and it was really easy.  One thing I noticed when I don't PL arch is that my traps and upper right shoulder always loses tightness when lowering the weight down almost as if my right shoulder is slipping.  I think this may be happening because I'm not engaging my lats properly.  PL arching allows me to put myself in a position where the lats are fully engaged.

**Rows:**

5 x 75
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 135
3 x 150
8 x 115

Triple was definitely pretty heavy.  Definitely jerking the weight.

**Accessories:**

Dips - 14/8/5:  Difficult was a bit more "uniform" across all reps.  Before I would gas out fairly quickly, but today's felt like a more gradual progression of fatiguing from rep to rep until the very end of each set.

Barbell Curls - 8x50/8x55/6x60:  Pretty difficult.  Again, my right arm felt like it was doing a bit more work than the left.

Tricep Extensions - 8x50/8x55/6x60:  Not bad.  I rocked my upper arm backwards a bit on the negative.  I guess this uses a bit of shoulder.  I made sure to get ample rest between sets.
