This week's been fairly terrible with regards to my mental state with working out as well as my food intake.  Too much Skyrim has cost me precious sleeping hours and my energy levels took a toll because of it.  I've also worked out twice a week for the last two weeks including this week.  Need to get out of this lazy hump and get focused.

**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
5 x 225

Decided to go light on the squats, wasn't feeling up to my best and I really didn't want to injure myself.  Pussy out?  Yeah, most likely.  Excuses are like assholes, everyone's got one.

**Bench:**

****2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 75
3 x 95
2 x 115
1 x 135
2 x 165

Stalled oh so very, very hard on these.  I noticed that using a powerlifter's arch sort of removed the load from the chest.  Quite possibly why chest isn't as big as it should be.

**Rows:**

5 x 95
3 x 115
2 x 135
5 x 155

Went back to good 'ole bent-over BB rows.  155 felt fairly heavy.

**Accessories:**

9/4/4 x BW + 15lb Dips - Still stuck at BW + 15 lbs.
