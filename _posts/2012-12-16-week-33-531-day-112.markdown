**Cycle #6
Week 2 Day 4**

**Warm-up Deadlift:  **5x115, 3x145, 3x170
**5/3/1 Deadlift:  **5x200, 5x230, 5x260
**BBB Deadlift:  **5x10x145

Felt like I was rounding my back on the way up.  Wasn't keeping my head inline with my spine and so I ended up lifting my butt up first.  Didn't keep a tight midsection and so my chest buckled in.  Going to have to record myself again.

Cracking left knee and unstable right shoulder.  Sometimes these hindrances can play with my head.
