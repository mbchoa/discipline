**Cycle #5**

**Press: ** 5x45, 5x55, 3x70 + 3x80, 3x95, 2x105 **
**

Used a regular grip on all sets including warm-up.  Seems like I'm a lot weaker when using regular grip.

**BBB Press:  **10/10/8/6/6

Really fatigued traps by this point.  I just felt like I didn't have any gas at all.

**BB Assistance:**

DB Military Press – 4 x12 x 10lbs
Side Laterals/Rear Laterals – 2 x 2 x12 x 10lbs
Barbell Curls – 4 x12 x 20lbs
Preacher Curls – 4 x10 x 35lbs

**Conditioning:**

2min. x 2.0 spd, 10% incline warm-up
2 x 1min. 5.0 spd, 10% incline sprint
6.0 spd + 7.0 spd + 8.0 spd x 1min. no incline
Cool down fast walk to 1mile
