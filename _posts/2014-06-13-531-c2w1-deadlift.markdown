**Deadlift:  **5x105 + 5x130 + 3x160 + 5x170 + 5x195 + 7x225 (270.04 1RM)
**BBB Squat 60%:  **5x105 + 5x135 + 5x10x160
**Crunch Machine:  **3x10x30

BBB Squats were pretty brutal.  Good thing I belted up on these.  I had to rest a good 3-4 minutes between sets.  After the deadlifts, I was already pretty low in the tank, but I was pretty dead set on finishing out all 5 sets no matter what.  This concludes the first week of the second cycle.
