**Squat:  **5x105 + 5x135 + 3x155 + 5x170 + 5x195 + 5x225
**BBB Deadlift 60%:  **8/5/6/6/6 x 160

Absolutely brutal.  Legs were shot from no squatting for 2 weeks.  Lesson to learn- don't skip out on rest week just because it's called a rest week.  Deadlifts were insane.  I was barely able to get through the 5 sets.  I'll have to belt up on these, no question about it.  The second month of the 3-month challenge meant that I had to increase weight on the BBB to 60% of 1RM.  My diet was not up to par the last week.  I haven't been able to consistently cook for myself- schedule's out of whack.  I didn't have time to go through my full warm-up- I had less than an hour before gym close time.
