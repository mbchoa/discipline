**Cycle #3**

**Deadlift:**  5x115, 5x140, 3x17 + 5x210, 3x240, 3x270

Lifts felt good.  The triple was definitely a struggle.  Didn't keep the bar close on the first set.  The business socks are helping a bit.  I might look into investing in some thicker ones to protect my shins better.  I'd rather not have to think about my shins when I'm pulling.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Squat**: 5x135, 3x155 + 10/7/6/4/5 x 195

I wanted to get 10 reps on the first set.  My endurance has definitely improved compared to  my previous BBB squat assistance sessions.  I was pretty gassed by the fourth set.  I rested plenty for the fifth and comfortably cranked 5 out.

**Ab Wheel**:  10/6/5/4

Squats left me pretty dead at this point.  Core was definitely spent, I couldn't keep my torso rigid and felt like I was straining my back on the roll out..
