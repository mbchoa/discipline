**Cycle #5
****Week 1 Day 3**

**5/3/1 Bench:  **3x100, 3x115, 8x135
**BBB Bench:  **5x10x80
****Core: **** 5xF Situps + 2x10 Lying Leg Raises
**Conditioning: ** Cycling intervals 20min.

Foam rolling was agonizing.  DOMs finally kicked in today and my legs were just in pain when I was rolling them out.  I do a full out 10-15 minute work out now.  Agile 8, leg swings, arm swings.  Bench press felt very easy.  Used a powerlifters arch for the last set.  My right arm/pec/shoulder was working harder than my left, especially once the fatigue started setting in during the Boring But Big assistance.

No more running or walking for at least a month to see how my left knee does.  Chrondromalacia patella is a common problem among athletes that run a lot.  Doctor's diagnosis says that my knee join felt very smooth, no crunchiness that is normally associated with this problem.  But, of course, he recommended I avoid any walking, running or jumping for another month to 6 weeks or so.  With this in mind, I have to get a bit creative on cardio.  Interval cycling was the recommended temporary alternative.  I did 20 minutes of interval cycling- wasn't too bad.  Definitely expected worse, but then again, my interval running on the treadmill were pretty ridiculous.
