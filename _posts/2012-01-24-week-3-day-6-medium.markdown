**Squats:**

5 x 120
5 x 145
5 x 175
5 x 205
5 x 235

Not too bad, definitely took my time between the heavier sets.  I've gotten lazy with recording myself, but I think it's about time I start doing so.  I felt fairly comfortable with my form today, no lower back pain at all.

**Bench:**

5 x 65
5 x 85
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 125

Felt more comfortable with my form today.  I didn't tuck my elbows in as much.  My left elbow flared a bit much on one of the reps.  But other than that, the weight still feels relatively light.  Can't wait to get that plate up there again.

**Rows:**

****5 x 65
5 x 85
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 125

These were still pretty easy.   As usual, lift off ground and accelerate towards chest.

**Accessories:**

Weighted Situps: 10xBW, 10x7.5, 10x10, 10x10 - Not bad, felt the burn more in my hip flexors.  I think I need to curl into my knees.

Weighted Hyperextensions: 10xBW, 10x10, 10x15 - Pretty easy, but my knees were killing me.  Felt like they would snap backwards from the counter-balancing.

HIIT: 10 minutes - Feeling sluggish on the HIIT.  My peak heart rate was at 189 bpm, definitely out of running shape.
