First week to stall on the squats.  I'm fairly happy for being able to make it 9 weeks in without stalling on the squat.  I'm a bit annoyed at my bench.  I'm still having a fairly difficult time with it and barely cranked out the last reps.  Tucking my elbows helped quite a bit to lessen my elbows flaring out.  Rows were difficult, I'm not sure if I'm jerking and using hip drive, I'll have to record myself.
