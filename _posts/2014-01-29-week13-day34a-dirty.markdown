**Weight:  **185 lbs
**Duration:  **11:35am - 12:40pm ~ 1hr 5min

Had some not so wonderful food post workout.  I believe the term coined in the bodybuilding community is "dirty bulk".  I've been pretty aggressive on the face stuffing for the last week and a half or so.  The "see food" diet.  I'm a firm believer in simple calories in/calories out, BUT, I also like to believe in putting good quality calories in 90% of the time.  My current weight is roughly where I was floating around at the peak of my strength some 1.5 to 2 years ago.  My lift poundages, however...are no where near what I was lifting a littler over 2 years ago (Fall 2012).

**Squats:  **3x5xBar +5x115 + 3x135 + 2x155 + 1x175 + 3x5x200

Shoes off, was heavy, but made sure to avoid going too deep into the hole to avoid rounding the back.  I felt a bit more forward lean, but I tried to keep my neck in line with my spine.  Other than that, it wasn't too bad.  Mentally, I think, knowing that I've cut out the 4th and 5th sets, I have a bit more confidence in avoiding injury so I can squat without any hesitation.

**Bench:  **3x10xBar + 5x65 + 5x85 + 3x105 + 5x5x125

The first 3 sets of the work weight felt pretty light.  Last 2 sets, there were a few small grinders, mainly lockout of the bar.

**Rows:  **5x85 + 3x105 + 1x120 + 5x5x140

Damn heavy.  Strict Pendalay was out the window, I was definitely jerking upwards.  The one thing I tried to pay attention to is to control the bar on the negative.
