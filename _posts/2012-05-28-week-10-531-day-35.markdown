**Cycle #3**

I don't remember my stats, but I think this is a rep PR on the press.  I definitely could have managed a few more reps.

**Press:**  5x75, 3x85, **4x95**

Accidentally did 2 extra reps on the first set.

**Boring But Big 70%**

**Bench Press**: 3x10xBar + 5x10x115

My bench felt very strong today.  Managed to bang out all the reps on each set.  I wasn't tucking my elbows as much.  And I also wasn't locking out.  I noticed that when I lockout at the top, my shoulder blades naturally protract thereby making me lose tightness in my upper back.

**Curls**:  3x10x40 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x35 + **Face pull: **3x10x25

Curls were were a bit easier than last time.  Tricep pushdowns were extremely easy.  Face pulls got my anterior delts burning a bit.

**Treadmill:  **15min at 2.5 speed + max incline.
