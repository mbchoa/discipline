Squats were not bad, had a bit of pain afterwards, but I think the pain from my previous day of deadlifts carried over.  Bench felt pretty weak today, I couldn't get a proper form on it.  My last set was the best of all the worksets; this was the case because I felt I used more of my lats.  Rows were very difficult, again my back was in a bit of pain from the deadlifts the previous day.  Level 3 core exercises were more difficult than I expected; I didn't have much endurance.  HIIT was very easy.
