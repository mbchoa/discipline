**Weight:  **182 lbs

Didn't eat anything until after the workout.  Felt a slight lack of energy because of this, but I still managed to crank reps out.  In addition, Wednesday is also prescribed for light lifting so the session went by pretty quickly.  The deadlifts were not so light.  I tried to keep the bar close to the body, but not driving the bar into my shins.  I did not think to belt up for the top set because of it being light day.  BUT, presses and deadlifts are only worked once a week on Madcow so in actuality...it was not a light day for over head pressing and deadlifting.  Don't think form was there on the top set, core probably couldn't take the load and so I may have rounded a bit.  Sprinkled in a few sets of crunches in the end.

**Squats:  **5x115 + 5x145 + 5x175 + 5x175

**Press:  **5x45 + 5x45 + 5x65 + 5x65

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 5x185 + 5x225 + 5x250

**Crunches:  **4x25
