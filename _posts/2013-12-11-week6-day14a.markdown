Good workout!  Weights are still relatively light.  Squats got me nervous a bit- slightly hard to stabilize the heavier weight.  Had a harder time with getting my right shoulder to cooperate with the bar grip today.  In other words, I was in some degree of pain, more so than last session.  Bench was slightly easier today.  Rows were still pretty easy.  Performed some more chest isolation again with some heavier weights performed than previously.
