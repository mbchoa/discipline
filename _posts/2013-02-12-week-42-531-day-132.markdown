**Cycle #4
Week 3 Day 2**

**Warm-up Squat:  **5x100, 3x125, 3x150**
5/3/1 Squat:  **5×185, 3×210, 4x235

Woke up late, getting in 10 hours of sleep.  No good.  Didn't leave me time to do accessories or conditioning.  Did the top set with a belt on.  Left knee cracked loudly during one of the reps.  Lower back towards the left was aching a bit.  Think, I need to do some warm-ups for my low back and abs to make sure I'm keeping my trunk rigid during heavy squatting or deadlifting.
