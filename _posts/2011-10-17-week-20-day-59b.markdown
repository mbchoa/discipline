**Squats:**

5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
3 x 5 x 235

I really wanted to finish this.  I had stalled on this weight before but it was 5x5, so there should be no excuse to not finish only 3 sets of this.  I spent a good amount of time resting after the second set to make sure I finished all three sets.  Form is definitely going down the toilet as I get more fatigued.

**Press:**

****5 x Bar
3 x 55
2 x 65
3 x 5 x 85

Decided to jump 5 pounds instead of 2.5 for this workout.  Surprisingly easy.

**Deadlift:**

5 x 145
5 x 175
3 x 205
2 x 235
5 x 270

The extra 5 repper in the beginning definitely got me more fatigued for the heavier warm-up sets and eventually the work set.

**Accessories:**

5/3/2 x BW Pull-ups
1:7 - 1.5:4 - 1:8
