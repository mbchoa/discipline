**Cycle #1**

**Agile 8 + DeFranco's  **

**Squat:**  5x105, 5x135, 5x160

Easy and light.

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Deadlift:  **5x10x135

Did touch n' go on the first set.  Reset after each rep on each set afterwards.

**Hanging Leg Raises**:  5x10

These were much easier today.  But, I think I may be doing the exercise wrong.  I touch the ground and restabilize myself after each rep, but this takes away the constant contraction in the abs when I have to restabilize myself.
