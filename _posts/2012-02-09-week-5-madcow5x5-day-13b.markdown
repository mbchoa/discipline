**Squats:**

5 x 125
5 x 155
5 x 190
5 x 190

These were really easy.  Not much to point out.

**Press:**

5 x 55
5 x 65
5 x 75
5 x 85

Not bad.  A bit difficult.  Right triceps were working a bit harder again.

**Deadlift:**

5 x 155
5 x 185
5 x 215
5 x 245

Not bad.  Did touch and go on the first set.  Banged my shin up in the process, so that's a no go.  Back was a bit more strained than last week.  I think I rushed it a bit.

**Accessories:**

Sit-ups - 33/13/11:  Used a 20lb dumbbell counterweight.  Actually worked quite nicely.  Feels as though my lower abs are being focused more than my upper abs.  Can't complain.

HIIT - 4-7-4-8-4-7:  Legs were feeling tired.
