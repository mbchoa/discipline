**Weight:  **181.2
**Duration:  **11:25pm - 12:25pm ~ 1 hour

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x85 + 3x95 + 3x115 + 5x5x135

Not bad, felt some strain on the lower back.  Stance was probably a bit too wide, was going a bit lower than parallel causing a greater degree of arch in the low back since I was keeping my torso up right.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 2x5x65 + 5x5x85

Shakey, but not as heavy as last time.  I think I performed the best rep on the last rep of the last set.  I'm noticing that I'm shrugging considerably more on my right shoulder vs my left shoulder under load.

**Rows:  **5x65** + **5x85 + 5x5x100

Made sure to maintain extremely strict form on these.  In other words, no jerking of the bar up and cheating using momentum.  This involved pretty much a whole body contraction, core, glutes, upper back and bracing before every rep.  I always feel my legs working during these, not sure if this is expected or not.  Banged the bar on the bottom of my left knee cap on one rep.  Definitely not a pleasant feeling.

**Accessories:**


**Preacher **BB **Curls:  **10x40
**Preacher EZ Bar Curls:  **10x40
**Incline DB Press:  **10x30
**Standing BB Curl:  **10x40
**DB Bench Press:  **10x35
**Tricep Extensions:  **10x40
**Tricep Pushdown:  **20x25


Dumbbell bench pressing is bothersome to my right shoulder the less I tuck my elbows.  Pretty much did tucked pressing on these.  I think I might go with pushups over these next time.  The incline dumbbell press isn't too bad, there's less strain on the shoulder doing them so I'll keep doing them.
