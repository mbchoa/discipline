It's been almost 3 weeks since having last been on a relatively consistent training.  I'm keeping an account of this experience recovering from the surgery and no lifting .  This is somewhat inspired from the guy who went on his "fit2fat2fit" campaign where he pretty much went for, I believe, 6 months of eating very poorly and doing 0 exercise and then switching back to eating well and exercising.  My variation is...fit2skinny2fit.  I'm expecting to drop down to 160-165 lbs.

I've mentioned in a previous post that I will be undergoing a shoulder arthroscopic surgery this coming Friday. This basically means I won't be able to lift weights for a minimum of 3 months.  I've weighed myself a few times within the last week and have seen my weight as low as 176, down from 181.

I'm feeling especially groggy this morning, having that feeling of a warm invisible blanket over my entire body just beckoning me to go back to sleep.  Allergies are kicking up as well, left or right nostrils have been congested.
