**Cycle #1**

**Agile 8 + DeFranco's  **Took my time with these.  I skipped the 5 minute treadmill warm-up.  I figured the agile 8 alone should be sufficient to get the blood flowing.

**Bench Press:**  5x65, 5x80, 5x95

Very easy and light.

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Press:  **5x10x50 +** DB Row:  **5x10x30** **

Presses were definitely hitting my shoulders and lats hard.  Holding lockout at the top really burned my traps.  Right handed db rows seem to be harder than my left handed db rows.

**Curls: ** 3x10x30 +** Tricep pushdown: ** 3x10x30 +** Face pull:  **3x10x30

Used the rope for the face pulls instead of the row'ing bar.  Definitely felt more of my anterior delts getting worked.  Lowered the weight to 15 when using the new rope to get a feel for the technique.

**Treadmill 0.5 mile @ 3.0 + Agile 8 + Defranco's  **Decided to cut the treadmill work down to half a mile- less wear and tear on my knees.  And my legs were feeling especially tender and sore today so I decided to do another round of the agile 8 and defranco's to warm down with.  The foam rolling is definitely very therapeutic.  The soreness went away when I rolled my legs.
