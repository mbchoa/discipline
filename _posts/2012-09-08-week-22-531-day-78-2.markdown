**Cycle #6
Week 2 Day 4**

**Warm-up:  **foam roll, leg swings, box jumps

Foam rolling was torture today.  Insanely painful from the really sore legs from Tuesday squats.  Had to do them to get rid of the soreness and get my legs back into shape quicker.  Box jumps were pretty easy; a lot more confident with them compared to Tuesday where I had a minor slip up.

**Deadlift:  **5x120, 3x150, 1x80 + 3x210, 3x235, 10x265

No belt.  Managed to crank out 10 reps on the last set.  This matched my previous effort at 265.  Probably could have done more with a belt.

**BB Assistance:**

6/3/2 - Chin-ups: Pretty difficult as my grip was shot from the deadlifts.
3x15x40 - DB Rows:  Difficult after the chin-ups and deads.
