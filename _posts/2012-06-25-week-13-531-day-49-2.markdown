**Cycle #4**

Today's Monday.  Three days since this workout and my legs are still sore.

**Squat:  **5x115, 5x140, 3x170 + 5x185, 5x210, **6x240**

The work sets felt fairly heavy, I think I may have gotten myself a bit winded from the warm-up sets.  I really wanted to do much more on the last set, but I just couldn't crank out any more.

**BBB **Squat**:  **10-8-6-7-8x140

Pretty ridiculous.  This may as well have been a marathon run from the way my legs felt and how hard I was breathing after finishing each set.  I rested a bit longer for the latter two sets so I could do each set better than the last.

**Ab Work:  **

25 25lb Side Bends
15 Ab Wheel Roll Outs
10 10lb Weighted Situps

**Conditioning:**

10% incline
2min. warm-up 2.5spd
4x1min. sprint 5spd

These were pretty nightmarish after the squat workout.  Shirt was soaked after the workout.
