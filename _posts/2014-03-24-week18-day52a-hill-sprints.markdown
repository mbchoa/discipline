**Weight:  **??

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x195 + 2x225 + **3x255 (2)**

Stalled again at 255 on the Squats.  I immediately fell into grinding out the second and following third reps.  Not sure what happened, but I felt a lot of forward lean.  Stance may have been a bit too wide.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x75 + 3x95 + 2x115 + **5/4/4/3x135 (2)**

Form felt very inconsistent.  Tried shrugging the left shoulder more in an attempt to bring the load in line and not load my right arm and chest.  I should certainly have rested and proceeded to do the 5th set, but gave up on it.

**Rows:  **5x135 + 3x135 + 2x135 + **3x3x165 (1)**

The rows also didn't feel strong.  There was a lot of jerking movement to get the bar up- my torso was rising substantially.

**Accessories:
**Dips:  12/7/4/5 (28)
Pull ups:  2/2/2/2 (8)

**Conditioning:
**Hill sprints 1xwalk 40 yards + 3xsprint 40 yards

Did some hill sprints right across the street from my apartment building.  The last sprint really took the air out of my lungs, some lightheadedness followed.  Definitely happy I got around to doing these.  The hill is pretty steep and is approximately 36 yards.
