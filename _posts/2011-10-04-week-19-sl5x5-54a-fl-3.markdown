Extremely exhausting workout.  Didn't drink much water for the day and didn't get any food in before the workout.  Squats were pretty difficult, but pointing toes out more helped engage posterior chain, glutes and hamstrings.  Bench press was difficult.  Applying the PL arch helped a bit, but I didn't feel very strong with performing the reps.  Decided to force deload on the rows and drop it down to 135 to try and maintain good form.  Missing a workout definitely has its toll.  You would think that you'd be better rested and recovered, but I feel as though it actually hinders performance.
