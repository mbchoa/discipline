Heavy, heavy workout today.  6.5 hours of sleep and not enough eating are the likely factors to a pretty difficult workout.  I think I'm going back to rushing my squats again.  I tweaked my lower back while squatting on the 3rd set.  Still managed to finish my sets.

Bench was pretty heavy, but sufficient rest is key to getting all sets done.

Rows were heavy as well, I think I jerked the weight up on a few reps.  More rest needs to happen between latter sets to avoid cheating and using hip drive.
