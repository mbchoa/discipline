Everything was pretty peachy today.  That's until I decided to push the prowler.  I was aiming for 5 reps, thinking to myself, "This ought to be pretty easy!"  Man was I utterly wrong.  My legs were completely obliterated in a matter of 3 minutes flat.  I was experiencing all the symptoms of complete exhaustion: head in a daze, jello legs, sucking in air like it was my job.

Other lifts were light.  Less soreness overall.  Performed high reps on the bench and rows since they were so light.

I'm pretty happy that there's a prowler at the gym now.  The new space below the gym is rarely occupied, so it's a great place to warm up and push the prowler around.
