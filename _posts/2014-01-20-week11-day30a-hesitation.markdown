**Weight:  **181 lbs
**Duration:  **11:15 - 12:10 ~ 55 min.

Encountering and experiencing the unknown.  There's always an inherent feeling of hesitation, a feeling of awe, excitement or sometimes fear that goes along with it.  In the realm of lifting the iron, my past experience has dictated that achieving something beyond what I fathom to be my capable limits, the unknown, required me to have such an intense and single-minded focus on the lift at hand.  The most fearful part of lifting for personal records is the beginning of the lifts.  The beginning of the lift, for me, is the sole driver, mentally, of whether or not I'm going to finish that rep out or not.  Without intention, without conviction and without absolute confidence that I will accomplish what I've set out to do, I will have already placed myself in a dangerous place.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x115 + 3x135 + 2x155 + 1x175 + 5x5x190

Low bar position got better as I progressed.  Used a little low back as I was positioning my torso a bit too upright, my low back would round at the bottom.  Stayed inside the squat rack this time so I had the safety bars to catch the bar if I failed on the reps.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x55 + 3x75 + 1x95 + 5x5x15

First few sets felt pretty light.  I was tucking the elbows a lot so the forearms weren't perpendicular to the floor, or at least I didn't feel as if they were.  Almost couldn't finish last rep of the last set.

**Rows:  **5x65 + 3x85 + 1x105 + 5x5x130

These felt magically light.  I don't know what it was, but compared to the previous row'ing session, the weight felt considerably lighter.
