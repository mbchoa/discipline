Rest week.  Doing some additional accessories for the shoulders and chest.  Also played around with hang cleans.  I'm currently practicing it with an empty bar and following this video step-by-step.

The db bench press was bothersome for my right rotator cuff.  Found a dipping belt at the gym!  Did 5/3/3 on the dips and reps on the chinups.  Felt pretty strong on the reps, went down slow and controlled to avoid aggravating the shoulder joint.  Also went deep enough to have my arm hit 90 degrees to get good ROM on the exercise.  Drove back to apartment after and did some hill sprints.  The 2 sprints were pretty easy going.  Turned it up for the next 3 and was pretty spent afterwards.  I'll have to see if I can find a grassy hill.  The concrete isn't too friendly on the impact, running up the hill.
