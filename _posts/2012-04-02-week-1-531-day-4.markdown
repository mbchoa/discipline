**Cycle #1**

**Treadmill 5min. walk + Agile 8  **

**Squat:**  5x95, 3x120, 2x145 + 5x175, 5x200, 5x230

Still fairly light.  Tried to make sure I dug the bar low on my back.  It definitely does put my shoulders in an unfavorable position.

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Deadlift:  **5x10x135

Banged up the top part of my shin pretty badly.  Other than that, it was fairly easy.  I was a bit gassed as usual, but I think, in time, my body will get used to the hypertrophic nature of the assistance exercises.

**Hanging Leg Raises**:  10/7/6

I probably could have finished the second and third sets, but I wasn't really focusing on resting much; the gym was closing within 5 minutes when I first started the exercise.
