**Squat:  **5x100 + 5x135 + 3x155 + 3x180 + 3x205 + 3x230
**BBB Deadlift:  **5x10x135
**Vertical Knee Raises:  **5x10

The squats were tough.  The BBB deadlifts were even worse.  I took plenty of rest for the 4th and 5th sets.  Form and technique improved when I rested adequately.  Afterwards, I treated myself to a nice 5 sets of vertical knee raises on the captain's chair.  These were done with control to avoid swinging my legs up.
