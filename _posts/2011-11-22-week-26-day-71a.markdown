**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 165
3 x 185
2 x 205
5 x 230

I notice that when using the belt, sometimes I would find myself becoming unbalance and leaning forward.  I think I can alleviate this with a wider stance.  Other than that, the lift was pretty easy.  Belt helps a lot.

**Bench:**

****2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 85
3 x 105
2 x 125
5 x 140

Pretty easy.  Tucked my elbows in.  Pushed my feet into the ground to receive the load on my upper back.

**Power Cleans:**

****Worked mostly on practicing on an empty bar.  It's a bit harder to practice the full pull with no weight.  I don't think I'm engaging my hips or hammies enough and using too much of my arms to pull with.  I think I need to go over some more youtube videos and/or video tape my self to see if I'm doing it right.  The first pull is pretty intuitive, it's just a deadlift pull until I'm upright.  The second pull is where I'm sort of getting lost.  Hands were burning like crazy.

**Accessories:**

10.5/4/3 x BW + 10 Dips - Fairly difficult, I'm thinking I'll go up in weights again.  I think my bench going up near my 5RM max will definitely hinder my ability to pump out reps on these weighted dips.

3 x 12 x 10 lb Reverse Crunches - Pretty easy again.
