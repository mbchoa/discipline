**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 165
2 x 185
3 x 5 x 205

Guy was using the small seat for box squatting -_-  Did normal squats.  Made sure I wasn't going too low to avoid stressing the back.. Still no lower back pain.  Wide stance, split the floor apart.

**Bench:**

****2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 65
3 x 85
2 x 105
3 x 5 x 125

Not too bad, didn't feel like I was engaging my lats much this session.  Went for speed and power on the positive.

**Rows:**

****5 x 95
3 x 115
3 x 5 x 125

Pretty easy.  Was hitting my knees sometimes on the way up.  Again, went for speed and maximal power on each rep.  I'm going for explosiveness to allow for translation of power into punching power.

**Accessories:**

10/5/4 x BW + 10 Dips - Probably going to stay at this weight.

3 x 12 x 10 lb Reverse Crunches - Pretty easy, I think I'll stick with this weight for a while.

4 rounds Heavy Bag work - Each round lasted roughly 1-2 minutes each.  Got me pretty out of breath.  I'll be performing these instead of treadmill HIIT for now as I want to improve upon my boxing technique.
