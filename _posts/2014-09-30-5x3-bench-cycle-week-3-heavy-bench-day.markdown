**Bench Press:  **10xBar + 10x65 + 5x95 + 5x5x125
**DB Bench Press:  **3x10x30
**BB Rows:  **3x5x115
**Chinups:  **3/1.5/1.5
**Seated DB Press:  **3x10x35
**Seated DB Curls:  **10x25 + 8x25 + 4x25

Tried to keep rest times to a minimum, at most being 30 seconds.  Bench press was difficult, right arm was working harder.  DB bench press was pretty easy, kept the negative phase slow to avoid straining the rotator cuffs.  BB Rows were a little hard.  I haven't performed them in a while.  First set of chinups were really easy.  Going to shoot for increasing by 1 rep for the following session.  Seated DB presses at 30lbs were really easy so I went up to 35.  35s were still fairly easy, will start with 35 then go to 40 next session.  Biceps fatigued really quickly after first set on the db curls.
