Close, but no cigar.

I've had 21 physical therapy sessions, 3 a week, so I've been in PT for approximately 7 weeks.  I still have a little bit to go.  My overhead shoulder flexion is at about 93% of full 180 degrees.  External rotation not quite a bit there as well.  My strength is at about 85%.

In summary, the doctor's prescribed another month of pretty aggressive stretching.
