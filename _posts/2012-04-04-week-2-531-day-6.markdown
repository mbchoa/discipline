**Cycle #1**

**Treadmill walk 5min + Agile 8  **These continue to get me pretty gassed fairly quickly.

**Deadlift:**  5x115, 3x145, 2x175 + 3x190, 3x215, 3x245

Just realized that I used week 1 weights.  Fudge. Packer.

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Squat**: 5x10x135

First and second set was got me exhausted.  The subsequent sets were much easier.  I think I might record these assistance squats to see how my form does when I'm fatigued.  Since the weight is lighter, I definitely feel less load on my lower back.  I definitely feel my abs getting worked when pushing out of the hole.

**Ab Wheel**:  10/7/6/5/4

My back sort of bothered me when doing these.  I feel like my back is arching instead of maintaining rigidness.
