**Weight: **??

It's been about...a week and a half since being in the gym.  Getting acclimated to the new place and breaking my routine has cost me some gym time.  I should be back into the swing of things moving forward.  The time away from the gym was certainly refreshing.  It happened at a good time since I was planning on taking a light week to rest myself relatively soon anyway.  I dropped down 5lbs on the Squat from my last work weight, increased on the OHP- it's still light- and stayed at 265 on the Deadlift.  I wanted to do some hill sprints right next to my building, but I was running short on time to get to work, so I skipped it.  

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x150 + 3x175 + 2x195 + 1x225 + **2x255 (1)**

****Went for 255 on the top set, but managed a measly 2 reps.  It felt as though there was significant forward lean on the Squat.  Didn't feel up to rep'ing anymore than the two.

**Press:  **5x5x55

Pretty easy still.  Wobbly.

**Deadlift:  **5x135 + 3x175 + 2x205 + 1x235 + **3x265 (1)**

Grinding the shins pretty roughly on these.  I seem to be banging my left knee cap on the way down.

**Accessories:  
**Dips:  10/6/5/4/5  
Wide-Grip Pull-ups:  2/2/2/2/2

Pull-ups were a bit better, I went for 2 reps on each set.  The second was always not full ROM.  The dips weren't bad, right chest was working a bit harder again.
