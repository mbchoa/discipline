**Squats:**

5 x Bar
5 x 135
5 x 155
3 x 175
2 x 195
3 x 5 x 220

Pretty difficult.  I had a decent amount of rest for the third set.

**Bench:**

****2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 95
3 x 115
3 x 5 x 145

Bench was really, really easy.  Noticed that a narrower grip engaged my upper back and lats a lot more than a wide grip.  **Width grip was positioned such that my** **pinkies were on the knurling****.  **Before I would employ a wider grip with my index finger on the knurling.  This was much more difficult and I definitely felt the strain on my anterior deltoids.

**Rows:**

3 x 5 x 140

Rows were easier now that I've deloaded on it.

**Accesories:**

13 x BW x Dips
