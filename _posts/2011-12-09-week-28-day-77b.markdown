**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
1 x 235
4 x 265

Stalled.  My form was horrendous by the 4th rep.  My back was nearly parallel to the ground, trying to lift the bar up out of the hole.  Surprisingly, back felt fine, no soreness or pain at all.

**Press:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 65
3 x 75
2 x 85
5 x 95

Noticed that bar position was towards my fingers on the right hand to compensate for weight and therefore put more of the load on the right arm, felt it in the wrist.

**Deadlifts:**

5 x 155
3 x 185
2 x 215
5 x 245

Pretty easy still.  Used overhand-underhand grip.

**Accessories:**

5/4/2 x BW Pull-ups - Felt a bit stronger today on this exercise.  Right shoulder was definitely feeling weird because of my injury.
