**Cycle #5**

**Deadlift:  **5x100, 5x140, 3x160 + 5x190, 5x225, **11x250 Rep PR**

Crushed the deadlifts today.  Looks like I'm back into the swing of things.  Yesterday's press day was definitely off- my head wasn't in the right place.  Alternating grip on the last set.

**BBB Deadlift:  **5x10x145

Felt relatively light.  I also used the belt on every set here.  I touch and go'ed all the sets.  The latter sets I would do a quick 5-rep, pause, then finish the set.  The one thing I don't like about doing touch and go is that I end up performing more of a straight legged deadlift as opposed to a regular deadlift.  I tried to quickly drop my butt after each rep so that I was engaging my hamstrings each time and not pulling with a straight leg.

**Core:**

10 x BW + 10 x 10lb Weighted Sit-ups
25 x 25lb Side Bends
10 x Lying Leg Raises
6 x Kneeling Ab-Wheel Roll Outs

My core was pretty shot from the deadlifting.  I could barely keep my body rigid on the ab wheel roll outs- my back would just buckle in.  Weighted sit-ups don't feel as terrible anymore compared to the first few times I did them.

**Conditioning:**

3min. 2.5 spd warm-up @ 10% incline
4 x 1min. 5.0 spd sprints with 1min. rests @ 10% incline
7.0 spd sprint to 1 mile mark @ no incline

Left knee was feeling scarily unstable.  Felt better later.
