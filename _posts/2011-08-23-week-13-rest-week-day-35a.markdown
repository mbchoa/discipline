Today's my first day of recovery.  I decided on lower volume and intensity for this week because I felt that my body wasn't recovering fast enough to keep my going workout to workout.  In addition, mentally I was very exhausted, motivation was very low when going to the gym.  I've also decided to force deload my squats because I feel as though my form has deteriorated to the point where, if I continue doing what I'm doing, I would most likely end up injuring myself very badly.

I arrived to the gym much earlier than usual so I took my time with my warm-ups.  Squats felt relatively light compared to the 230 I was rocking a week ago.  I felt pain in my lower left back area when warming up and all throughout my sets.  Benching was a bit heavy as I decided to continue progressing on the lift but with just recovery volume, 3x3.  I think the problem with my technique is that I'm not benching straight down and straight up.  I noticed that I shift the bar a lot when pressing the weight, usually shifting the bar to the right a bit.  Also, I think I need to find the correct bar width grip.  Many times, I think I may be gripping to narrow and therefore flaring my elbows when pressing.  For some reason, when I engage my back into a powerlifter arch, it seems as though the lift becomes significantly easier.  I think this has a lot to do with lifting stabilization.  When I start from a flat back, I don't really engage my lats and upper back and stabilize, lending to my wobbly press when I press up.  Coinciding with this effect is that, I'm not using as much of chest as I want to and instead I feel my biceps and shoulder being worked and due to imbalance, my right side gets worked a bit more.  Rows were pretty heavy.  I tried using the hook grip and it did wonders for my gripping strength.  I can definitely see many people screwing their thumb up though using the hook grip.  I'm not sure if I will continue using the grip, but I think this would be the appropriate time to invest in some lifting straps.  It really does suck that the gym doesn't allow chalk use.
