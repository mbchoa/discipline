**Squats:**

5 x 115
5 x 140
5 x 170
5 x 195
5 x 230

These were pretty hard.  I felt some soreness pain from my quads near my knees when going heavy on the last set.

**Bench:**

5 x 65
5 x 75
5 x 90
5 x 115
5 x 125

These were alright.  Felt like I was, again, using my right arm more than my left.  Felt the burn in the right triceps.

**Rows:**

****5 x 65
5 x 85
5 x 95
5 x 115
5 x 125

These were particularly easy.  Again, made sure that I slowly lifted bar off ground and then exploded upwards to my chest.

**Accessories:**

Weighted Sit-ups:

12 x BW
12 x BW + 5

Second set was difficult.  Was cheating a little when sitting up by using momentum.

Weighted Hyperextensions:

12 x BW
12 x BW + 25
10 x BW
10 x BW

Not bad, my knees were hurting when doing them with weight.
