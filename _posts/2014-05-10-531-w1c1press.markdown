**Press:  **5x45 + 5x50+ 10x55
**DB Rows:  **3x10x50
**Shrugs:  **3x10x95

Short and sweet.  Work took over my life for the last 2.5 weeks so I missed many days since.  Training ADHD motivated me to move early onto Wendler's 5/3/1.  I was really satisfied with this program when I did it 2 years ago.  The weight progression is certainly slower on the lifts, but I was able to consistently break PRs and my strength shot through the roof.  At one point was able to do 15 straight reps of 275 Deadlifts.  Currently, I can struggle to maybe perform 5 reps at that weight.  I had coupled the program using the 3-month challenge variation on the "Boring But Big" assistance work.  It was very bland, but it certainly got my strength gains up.  As of now, I haven't concretely decided what assistance work regimen I will follow.  I'm more concerned with simply getting my core lift numbers up and maintaining a consistent training regimen.

My 1RM goals within the foreseeable future are:

315 Squat
375 Deadlift
185 Bench
135 Press/Clean
185 Row

The 315 Squat has been staring me dead in the eyes for the last 3 years and I've yet to conquer it.  My Bench has also been stubborn over the last couple of years.  With these 2 in mind, I think I'm going to gear my assistance towards trying to strengthen the weak points in each of the lifts.
