**Squats:  **5x5x55
**Bench:  **5x5x45
**Rows:  **5x65

Somewhat unexciting, but we're moving.  Slowly perhaps, but all in good time.  Did the regular band stretch work before and after the workout.  Also did some seated upright rowing on the machines to speed up strengthening the upper back.  Also did some leg swings and static squat stretches to wake up the legs.
