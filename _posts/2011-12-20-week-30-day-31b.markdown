**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 145
3 x 175
2 x 205
1 x 235
3 x 270

Widened the stance a bit and significantly changed the lift.  Definitely felt like I was leaning forward a ton and doing a good morning from the hole on the 3rd rep.  Stalled for the second time.

**Press:**

****5 x Bar
3 x 75
4 x 97.5

Stalled.  Went for form over satisfying the ego.

**Deadlift:**

5 x 155
3 x 185
2 x 215
5 x 250

Felt the lift in the legs quite a bit.  **Pushing gut out helps tighten core and keep back rigid**, definitely helps prevent rounding back.

**Accessories:**

4/2 x BW Pull-ups - Wasn't feeling these very much.  I was pretty spent by the end of the workout.
