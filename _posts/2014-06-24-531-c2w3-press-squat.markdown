Did some "catching up" today.  Missed presses yesterday so I added it before my main Squats lift.  Percentages all look like they're going up gradually.  I was extremely surprised out how well I was able to deal with the Deadlift.  Felt like night and day between today's BBB accessories vs last week's.  I was able to get to the end of the 4th set before I started breathing pretty heavily.  The week long break, I'm sure, helped a bit on recovery.

One thing that I realized I need to improve is my shoulder flexibility and primarily my right (bad) shoulder.  Pulling back my shoulders and squeezing the shoulder blades together is rather painful on the right side.  I pretty much have to use high bar position to lessen the pain OR widen the grip.
