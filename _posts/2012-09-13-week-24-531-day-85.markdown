**Cycle #6
****Week 3 Day 1**

Just did week's day 1 lift.  Was pretty busy Monday and Tuesday night.  Playing catch-up sucks a lot- it throws you off your rhythm.  But, on that same note, you have to learn to adapt and cope with the slight change.  Consistency is king when it comes to lifting and wanting to get results.

**5/3/1 Press:  **5x50, 3x70 + 5x90, 3x105, **2x115 Rep PR****
**

A few reps were a bit scary.  I dropped the weight a bit too quickly on a few reps and bent my wrists back too much.  I remember hitting this weight eons ago...probably sophomore year of college when I first started doing Stronglifts.

**BB Assistance:**

DB Military Press:  4x12x35lb
Barbell Curl:  3x10x30lb + 10x40lb
Side Laterals:  2x12x10lb
Rear Laterals:  2x12x10lb
Preacher Curl:  4x10x30lb

Upperback and biceps were burning and had that pumped sensation.  Side laterals and rear laterals were very taxing even though they were only 10lbs in each hand.  Dumbbell military press felt much more stable compared to the first time doing them.  I made sure to try and keep my elbows and forearms at right angles and making sure not to go too low to avoid stress on the shoulder joints.  Preacher curls felt light- I used preset bars, not ones to load plates on.  The barbell curl was easy, but taxing endurance-wise.

**Conditioning:**

6min. treadmill jog

Getting back to doing some cardio.
