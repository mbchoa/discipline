**Bench:  **5x55 + 5x70 + 5x80 + 5x90 + 5x100 + 11x115 (160 1RM)
**Boring But Big:  **5x8x70

Right chest was working harder on these.  Need to figure out how to correct my form on these.  Legs were still sore from the squat day 2 days ago.  I continue to do the Agile 8 as warm-up and to keep everything loose before hitting the bar.
