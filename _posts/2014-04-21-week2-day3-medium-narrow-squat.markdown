**Weight:  **184 lbs

Belted up on the last set of the squat.  I didn't go too deep and kept my torso fairly upright.  Felt some load on the quads.  Bench press was pretty light.  Rows weren't bad either.

**Squats:  **5x120 + 5x145 + 5x175 + 5x205 + 5x235

**Bench:  **5x65 + 5x85 + 5x100 + 5x115 + 5x130

**Rows:  **5x75 + 5x95 + 5x115 + 5x130 + 5x150

**Weighted Sit-ups:  **3x8x10lbs
