**Cycle #4**

I did an assortment of other very light empty bar lifts while I waited for my brother.  Incline bench, 25lb incline db press, barbell rows.  Pretty fun workout to say the least, I got to horse around a bit.

**Press:  **5x45, 5x55, 3x65 + 3x80, 3x90, **4x100 Rep PR**

Achieved a rep PR on the press.  I'm happy that I'm progressing on the press, even if it is a small amount.

**BBB **Press**:  **5x10x55

Surprisingly very easy compared to last session's BBB Pressing.

**Chin-ups:  **5/4/4/3/3

These felt very strong compared to the previous chin'ing session.
