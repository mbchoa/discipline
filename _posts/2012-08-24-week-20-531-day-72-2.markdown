**Cycle #5
****Week 4 Day 3**

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x70, 5x95, 5x105

Very light.  Locked in a good arch and spread my feet wide to tighten the glutes when pressing through the ground.  Grip was sufficient to get a semi-tuck of the elbows, but I flared them out a tiny bit because completely tucking caused me to lose perpendicular position between my forearm and the ground.

**BB Assistance:**

DB Fly - 4x10x15lb
Tricep Pushdown - 4x10x35lb
DB Bench Press:  2x10x30lb + 2x10x35lb
Dips - 10/10/5/5
