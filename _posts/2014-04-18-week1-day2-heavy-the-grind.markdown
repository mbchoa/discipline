**Weight:  **184 lbs

Did the heavy day today with heavy triples.  It was pretty difficult.  I didn't use the belt on the top set.  The increase in volume is definitely throwing me off.  I'm going to give myself another week to see if I can adjust to the volume before I drop the weights.  I will most likely belt up starting on the 4th set, even, on the medium days.

**Squats:  **5x115 + 5x145 + 5x175 + 5x200 + 3x235 + 8x175

**Bench:  **5x65 + 5x80 + 5x95 + 5x110 + 3x130 + 8x95

**Rows:  **5x75 + 5x90 + 5x115 + 5x125 + 3x150 + 8x115

**Tricep Extensions:  **10x40 + 10x45 + 10x50
**Bicep Curls:  **3x8x50
**Dips:  **8/7/4

**Conditioning:  **Incline treadmill @ 2.5 spd - 5 min.
