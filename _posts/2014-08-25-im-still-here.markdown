I've been fairly busy the last two weeks, but I am still alive and kicking!  Need to regroup and assess what long term goals will be more broadly.  I've been primarily focusing on improving strength since I've started weightlifting in college.  And while this is certainly a great thing, I do also feel that it is limiting.  Thinking on a broader sense, I'm slowly gravitating towards a more general idea of my developing overall health instead of just honing in on one thing.  This realization was really something of an epiphany during this last week when I consulted a coach and got a 1-on-1 lesson on olympic lifting and more specifically the snatch.  My flexibility was really lacking in the low back and my shoulders were very rigid and tight.  In addition, lately I've been noticing my shortness of breath when simply going up just 2 flights of stairs to get into my apartment.

Strength, alone, at this point, is not enough to sustain and improve my overall health.  I'm going to shift towards overall health and incorporate more heavily, conditioning / cardiovascular strength and even more so, flexibility and mobility.

This is the new era of change!
