**Weight:  **182.5 lbs  
**Duration:  **~1 hour

Did a pretty condensed and short warm-up again.  Need to do some more shoulder mobility exercises during warm-up.  I've only been doing lower body dynamic stretching.  Today's session was pretty exhausting.  I can clearly remember when I last did StrongLifts 5x5 with Squats going upwards of 225+ lbs and it was just absolutely brutal.  The linear progression that can be achieved doing 5x5 can only be sustained for so long, but I definitely feel like my linear progression is at the start of the plateauing phase.  

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x120 + 3x140 + 1x160 + 5x5x180

Right shoulder was pretty tight in the first few sets.  Loosened up a lot afterwards.  What helped me was assuming a very wide grip to start and then narrowing as I got under the bar.  Starting from a narrow grip then getting under the bar doesn't seem to play nicely with my right shoulder.  Again, I'll have to start doing some serious shoulder mobility exercises.  Last thing I want is to develop some chronic shoulder impingement issue.  I used kinesio tape on my left knee- it was given to me from the mum when I started talking about my left knee and its instability.  I can't tell whether or not it's helped- I do feel more confident with them on.  But, then again, this may just be a placebo effect.  I also wore a knee wrap over this which kept the entire area pretty tight, especially during squatting.  Not much lower back, so I'm happy about that.  Last 2 sets were definitely pretty rough.

**Bench:  **3x5xBar + 5x55 + 3x75 + 1x95 + 5x5x110

Used Dave Tate's setup on the bench, keeping the feet back and using a powerlifter arch.  I made a point not to full extend my right arm to avoid losing my scapular contraction aka squeezed shoulder blades.  I felt some load being transferred to my shoulders a bit.  Driving through with my feet was a bit weird since they were underneath me and my feet weren't planted on the ground, just the balls of my feet.  The lift did feel significantly lighter using this form.

**Rows:  **5x65** + **3x85** + **1x105 + 5x5x125

Pretty heavy.  Made the mistake of using 4, 10lb plates instead of using a bigger 25 or 35lb plate to get the barbell higher off the ground.  I was going upright and jerking a bit more on the last set, so strict Pendalay style was out the window.  

**Accessories:****  
**Preacher BB Curls:  10x50  
Incline DB Press:  10x40  
Standing EZ-Bar Curls:  10x40  
Dips:  7/4/3  
Seated DB Curls:  10x25  
Pushups:  12/12/10

10 rep preacher curls were very taxing, especially the last 2 reps.  Incline db pressing was a bit wobbly, but still pretty light.  I'm thinking of going up on these.  Dips were a bit easier today, less shakiness.  Pushups were also easier.  Forgot to do my planks!  The mat area was pretty packed.
