**Squats:**

2 x 5 x Bar
5 x 135
3 x 155
2 x 175
3 x 5 x 190

Legs were insanely sore the entire day.  Week's rest definitely took it's toll on my legs.  The extra HIIT the previous session may also have overtrained my legs.  My quads felt like they were ripping apart each rep.  I was, again, box squatting.  This is considerably more difficult, but I felt like my form improved drastically.  I was reading up on a random find I had about Dave Tate going through the squat motion inch by inch.  It's surprising that I can still find more techniques to improve squat technique.

**Press:**

5 x 45
3 x 5 x 65

The first set was difficult.  I noticed that the bar was resting on my palm instead of the bottom of my hand.  This put the load on my wrists and debilitated power transfer when raising the bar overhead.  I corrected this and the lift was significantly much easier the following 2 sets.  And I was only lifting 65!

**Deadlift:**

5 x 145
3 x 164
2 x 185
5 x 205

The lift was pretty easy.  I didn't have to resort to alternating grip yet.

**Accessories:**

3/2/2 x BW Pull-ups - I've been at these rep ranges for a long time now.  I'd like to see why I'm not improving much on this exercise

5spd x 10 min. Treadmill - Legs were pretty beat, decided to forgo the HIIT for the day and just do steady-state for the same amount of time.
