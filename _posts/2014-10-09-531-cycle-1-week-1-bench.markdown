**Bench:
**5x65 / 5x80 / 3x95
5x100 / 5x120 / 5x135

Felt very confident on the bench press today.  Didn't feel any load imbalances.  Slow negative to ensure I'm engaging everything equally and then explode upward on the positive.  Used a thumbless grip as well.

**Barbell Rows: **5x10x95

Not bad for doing 5 sets of 10.  May switch to performing dumbbell rows instead.  I find that the lower bar position due to smaller plates is causing me to involve my lower back and hamstrings more as if doing a deadlift.

**Barbell Curls:  **10x40 / 6x40 / 8x40

Supersetted the barbell curls with the barbell rows.  Bad idea.  Both exercises target the biceps and so I quickly suffered from the fatigue when doing the barbell curls on the 2nd and 3rd sets.  Rested a bit longer before doing the last set.

**Seated Tricep Extensions:  **10x45 / 10x50 / 10x50

Love doing these.  Ever since discovering them while on the Madcow5x5 routine, I've always incorporated them in any routine needed some tricep isolation work.

**Bent Lateral Raises:  **10x15 / 10x10 / 10x10

Not a fan of doing these.  I'll stick with them for a bit more to see if my shoulder strength improves from it.
