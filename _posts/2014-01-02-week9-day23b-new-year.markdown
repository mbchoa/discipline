**Weight:  **179.6 lbs
**Duration**:  11:40 to 12:35 = 55 min.

The duration doesn't include warm-up.  I officially got to the gym at 11:20ish.  The warm-up was a bit longer today as I incorporated some Agile 8 into the mix to get my legs prepped better.  More warm-ups = more time spent outside of office soooo I'll have to be super efficient with my core lifts and try not to rest for too long.

**Squats:  **3x5xBar + 5x95 + 3x115 + 1x135 + 5x5x155

My shoulder is still cooperating!  I was able to get the bar off the right traps and on the top of the posterior delts.  There was definitely still a bit of resistance, but I once it was placed the bar was pretty much locked in.  The "shelf" that Mr. Rippetoe was talking about in his bar position video felt super solid and super stable.  The squats definitely felt heavy today.  I felt like my knees were travelling forward a bit.  Felt a little lower back engagement on a few reps when this happened.  This reminds me...I need to start video recording myself again!!  Also, I noticed that my right quads were a bit more worked than my left.

**Seated Plate Raises:  **3x8x35
**Seated Lateral Raise:  **3x8x10
**Seated DB Shrug + Clean + Half Press:  **3x8x10

Jumped up to 35 lbs on the plate raises.  These drained the life right out of my shoulders as I went from set to set.  I could barely get through the first 2 reps of the third set on the plate raises.  I think I have to stagger the weight on each start of the plate raise sets.  The fatigue just builds up way too quickly for me to recover and do honest reps with good form.

**Deadlift:  **5x125** + **3x145 + 2x165 + 1x185 + 5×205

Progressively increased resting time between warm-up sets as I worked my way up to the top set.  I used an alternate grip on the last set and it felt very solid.  The left hand was supinated while the right hand was using regular pronated grip.

**Accessories:
**Preacher BB Curls 10x50
Standing BB Curls 10x50
Seated DB Curls 8x25
Incline DB Press 10x35
DB Bench 10x35
Tricep Extensions 15x40

Did some tricep extensions to hit the triceps a bit more and give the chest a bit of rest.

**Core:
**Pushup-Position Planks 3x30sec.

Was browsing through imgur and found one of the 30 day get more fit things and saw one for planks.  This motivated me to start doing some regular core training.  I did 3 sets of 30 sec. planks using the top pushup position instead of the more popular elbow planks.  I'll see if I can do these daily and increase the length of time by 5 seconds each day.
