**Squats**:  5x5x70

**Press**:  5x5x50

**Deadlift**:  1x5x105

Back from travelling overseas.  Surprisingly, it's been almost a whole month since I've been to the gym.  The new StrongLifts5x5 app was kind enough to let me know that I had been away
for some time and suggested I deload the weight on the bars down by 30%.  It's good to be back.  I'm hoping I don't encounter another long hiatus on lifting, but who knows
what the future has in store.

Weights were all pretty light.  I'm glad I went through with the deload.  I was thinking of continuing where I left off, but I'm sure that would not have gone so well.

Didn't perform any accessories today, I wanted to get into work earlier today than my usual check in.  Usually, I get to work a little after 10am.  Decided to drive in by 8:30am.
Managed to be the first one to arrive!  Usually the manager checks in around 8am so it was a bit unusual getting there before him.
