**Cycle #1**

**Treadmill walk 5min + Agile 8 + DeFranco's Upperbody Stretches**

**Press:**  5x40, 5x50, 5x60

Very easy.  Used a thumbless grip on all sets.  Exploded from the rack position.  Slow controlled descent.

**Boring But Big 50%**

**Bench Press**: 2x10xBar + 5x10x85

Pretty easy now.  Made sure not to lockout to avoid protracting my shoulder blades.

**Lat Pulldown**:  5x10x40

Up'ed the weight 5 lbs.  I think I might increase assistance work weight every cycle.  Noticed that when pulling the bar to my chest that sometimes I would lean back.  Not sure what the proper technique for doing a lat pulldown is, but I think leaning back is considered cheating a bit.  I tried, instead, to maintain a fairly upright torso position on contraction to put work emphasis on the upper back traps and lats.

**Curls**:  3x10x30 + ****Tricep** **pushdown**:  **3x10x30 + **Face pull:  **2x10x30

Pretty easy now.  I've gotten used to the extra assistance work.  Love the pumped feeling. Bro statement.

**Treadmill walk 1 mile @ 3.0 speed**
