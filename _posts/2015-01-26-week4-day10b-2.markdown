Preparing for winter storm Juno here in New York.  Luckily was able to do some grocery shopping right after the gym (ShopRite is right next door!)

The session went well.  The squats felt pretty easy.  I had a pretty slow descent and accelerated up from a dead stop in the hole.  Presses were difficult.  My left rotator cuff feels like it's externally rotating too much
sometimes especially when I'm grinding the bar up.  

Deadlifts were still pretty easy.  I'm excited to get the lift back up to 225lbs soon.  

Chinups were pretty difficult today.  I felt very heavy trying to get my chin up to the bar today.

Prowler pushes are getting easy!  I decided to go for 4 sets instead of just 2.  With adequate rest between the sets, I was able to do another 2 sets of 2 and 1.5 reps, respectively, down the lane.

Had a protein shake 30 minutes after and another 30 minutes later, a small bowl of leftover chicken tikka masala with rice and chinese spare ribs from last night's Chinese food.  Certainly not the cleanest, but also not the dirtiest.
