**Cycle #6
Week 2 Day 2**

**Warm-up:  **foam roll, leg swings, box jumps

I haven't done the agile 8 in a while- I've only been foam rolling consistently.  I used the highest box there and it was pretty easy.  Did 3 sets of 5 reps.  My phone jumped out of my pocket twice.

**Squat:  **5x115, 3x135, 1x165 + 3x190, 3x215, 4x240

Decided to jump back to cycle 1 weights to get myself together.  Got good depth on all the reps.  Legs were feeling very jello-like by the end of the 215 set; they were tight and had that pumped feeling.  I had difficulties getting up from a chair that night.

**BBB Squat:  **5x10x135

Pretty easy first 2 sets.  Next 3 sets progressively became more taxing.  I was using my back to get the bar up in the latter reps- not in a bad good morning way, but my shoulder would go up before my hips would go up.  Partial good morning into a semi push press to exaggerate, but definitely nothing like that.

**BB Accessories: **

35/25/19/18 - Situps:  Slowly developing some muscle endurance in the abs.
